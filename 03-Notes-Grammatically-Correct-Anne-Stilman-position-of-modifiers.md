# Grammatically Correct (Anne Stilman)

## Positioning of Modifiers

- A Modifier is an element of a sentence that describes or qualifies some other element.
- Adjectives, and adverbs are the most common modifiers, but a phrase or dependent clause can act as one too.
- All elements in a sentence must be positioned so that any modifier is acting upon what it is supposed to.
  Failure to do so may lead to some disconcerning results. There are THREE types of problems to look out for:

  - DANGLING MODIFIERS
  - MISPLACED MODIFIERS
  - SQUINTING MODIFIERS
