  - Ensuring that a pronoun agrees with its antecedent

## Determining the right pronoun

- Unlike nouns, pronouns change form depending on what role they play in a sentence.
- The different forms that a pronoun can take on are called cases.
- There are three cases:

- 1.  Subjective case
  - When a pronoun represents the subject, or actor.
  - Example
    - `I` will be late
- 2.  Objective case
  - It is used for a pronoun that represents the object, the entity affected by the action of the subject.
  - Example
    - Don't wait for `me`.
- 3.  Possessive case
  - It is used to indicate ownership, and differs depending on whether the pronoun precedes or follows the possessed object
  - Example
    - That's `my` soup.
    - The soup is `mine`.

### PERSONAL PRONOUNS

- Personal pronouns are used as stand-ins for the names of specific people or things.

- The SUBJECTIVE PERSONAL PRONOUNS are - `I`, `you`, `he`, `she`, `it`, `we`, and `they`
- These are used when the pronoun represents the subject of the sentence - the actor or the focus of interest.

- The OBJECTIVE PERSONAL PRONOUNS are - `me`, `you`, `him`, `her`, `it`, `us`, and `them`
- These are used when the pronoun represents the object of the sentence - something that is acted or affected by the subject.

- The POSSESSIVE PERSONAL PRONOUNS are - `mine`, `yours`, `hers`, `its`, `ours`, and `theirs`.
- These are used to define who owns something.

- CONFUSION BETWEEN the SUBJECT and OBJECTIVE CASES ARE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS:

  - 1. When the sentence has more than one subject.

    - `Sarah and me` bought some shoes (INCORRECT)
    - `Sarah and I` bought some shoes (CORRECT)

  - 2. When the sentence has more than one object

    - Examples
      - If you have any questions, please let Sara and `I` know (INCORRECT)
      - If you have any questions, please let Sara and `me` know (CORRECT)
    - This type of error is particularly likely to occur when the pronoun is the
      object of a preposition rather than the object of a verb.
    - The OBJECTIVE CASE is always required when a pronoun follows a preposition
      - give that `to me`
      - she went to the appointment `with him`
    - If another OBJECT intervenes between the preposition and pronoun, the subjective case may be mistakenly used.
      - The news came as a shock `to Sam and I`. (INCORRECT)
      - The news came as a shock `to Sam and me`. (CORRECT)

  - 3. When the pronoun is immediately followed by the noun it represents

    - The noun in such a case is called an `appositive`, a word that renames an adjacent word.
    - The presence of an appositive can be distracting, but it does not alter the subject/object distinction.
    - In this situation, simply treat the pronoun as you would if the appositive were not there: that is, use the subjective
      case if the pronoun is the actor, and the objective case if it is the target of an action.
    - Example
      - `Us` drudges would like to have the day off / Just give that job to `we` drudges. (INCORRECT)
      - `We` drudges would like and give that job to `us` drudges. (CORRECT)

  - 4. When the sentece has an elliptical construction
    - This refers to wording in which some element that can be inferred from the context is dropped.
    - Since the subject is usually followed by a verb (an action or a description) whereas an object
      is not, it is an understandable error to assume that an objective pronoun should be used whenever no verb follows.
    - Examples
      - Louie can yell louder than `him` (elliptical construction)
      - She thinks she is better than `me` (elliptical construction)
      - The explosion startled Oscar as much as `they` (elliptical construction)
    - Both of the examples given above are elliptical construction for
      - Louie can yell louder than `he` can (correct version)
      - She thinks she is better than `I` am (correct version)
      - The explosion startled Oscar as much as it startled `them` (correct version)
  - If you are uncertain, mentally fill in the missing words to determine whether the pronoun is acting as
    a SUBJECT or an OBJECT

- 5.  When the pronoun follows any form of the verb to be
  - This includes all tense formations: `am`, `are`, `is`, `was`, `were`, `will be`, `being`, `been`, `had been`, `have been`.
  - In such constructions, the pronoun always takes the SUBJECTIVE CASE.
  - Examples
    - Old King Cole was a merry old soul, and a merry old soul was `he`
    - The only attendees still awake at the lecture were Michelle and `I`.
  - If you switch the wording around, it becomes clear that the pronoun is acting as the subject: `he` (not `him`)
    - `He` was a merry old soul
    - `I` was still awake / Michelle and `I` were the only attendees awake.

#### Test your knowledge (Which Pronoum is correct?)

- 1. Felicia and (`I`/me) polished off the roast ox.
- 2. Both Aunt Minnie and (`I`/me) were hauled off from interrogation.
- 3. My brother can crochet better than (`I`/me).
- 4. The guys at the office gave Alice and (I/`me`) matching garden gnomes.
  - the pronoun is one of the objects of the verb `gave`
- 5. Thank you for inviting Roland and (I/`me`), but we both have to wash our hair that night.
  - the pronoun is one of the objects of the verb `inviting`
- 6. Just between you and (I/`me`), I think he is lying through his teeth.
  - the pronoun is one of the objects of the preposition `between`
  - `between you and I` is a very common error
- 7. Sidney wanted the job more than (`I`/me)
  - Sidney wanted the job more than `I` wanted the job
- 8. Sally's not nearly as pernickety as (`she`/her)
  - Sally's not nearly as pernickety as `she` is.
- 9. The space shuttle landing in the backyard excited Abe more than (they/`them`)
  - The space shuttle landing in the backyard excited Abe more than it excites `them`
- 10. I felt that the last person I could trust with the chocolate truffles was (`he`/him)
  - The pronoun follows a form of the verb to be (was), and is therefore SUBJECTIVE.
- 11. A fine pair of fashion plates are (`we`/us)!
  - The pronoun follows a form of the verb to be (are), and is therefore SUBJECTIVE.
- 12. The dean told (we/`us`) that jocks that we'd better shape up academically.
  - Both the pronoun and noun are objects of the verb `told`
- 13. The dean said that (`we`/us) jocks had better shape up academically.
  - Both the pronoun and noun are subjects
- 14. For (we/`us`) baby boomers, the economic future is looking less rosy than the past.
  - Here both the pronoun and its appositive are the objects of the preposition `for`, and the pronoun
    there fore takes the objective case.
- 15. There wasn't much attention left over the second-place finisher, (I/`me`).
  - The pronoun is an appositive to second-place finisher. Both are the objects of the preposition `for`,
    and the pronoun therefore takes the objective case.

### Possessive Pronouns

- The possessive personal pronouns are used to define who owns something.

  - They are `mine`, `yours`, `hers`, `his`, `its`, `ours`, and `theirs`

- Things to keep in mind

  - Apostrophe or not?
    - Joe's place
    - Your's, her's
  - `Its` or `It's`?
    - `It's` not fair, every dog has `its` own day.
  - `Your` or `You're`

    - Your welcome (INCORRECT) / You're welcome (CORRECT) / You are welcome (CORRECT)

  - `Their` or `They're`
    - `They're` moving our
    - `Their` house

### Relative Pronoun

- Reflexive Pronouns are pronouns that end in -self.
- The most common error involving these pronouns is the use them when they are completely uncalled for.

- THE ONLY CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THE `-SELF` FORM A PRONOUN IS APPROPRIATE ARE THE FOLLOWING:

  - 1. When the subject and object are the same entity (that is, when they reflect each other)

    - You take `yourself` too seriously.
    - She looked at `herself` critically.
    - The machine turned `itself` off automatically.
    - The little piggy took `himself` off to the market.

  - 2. When you need to clarify that the subject has performed some action alone unassisted

    - I couldn't possibly go by `myself`.
    - Shoshanna did all the cooking `herself`.
    - Did you finish that entire sugar pie `yourself`.
    - They cleaned up all by `themselves`.

  - 3. When the pronoun acts to `emphasize` another word (in this role, it is called an `INTENSIVE PRONOUN`)
    - I `myself` would never sink that low.
    - Morris `himself` has no idea how the sour cream got into the DVD player.
    - We `ourselves` expected the worst.
    - My reputation `itself` was at risk.
    - I insist on having an appointment with Monsieur Andre `himself`.

- The ANTECEDENT (an·te·ced·ent) of a pronoun is the noun which it refers.
- The common mistakes that writer make
  - `MISSING ANTECEDENTS`, `INTERVENING ANTECEDENTS`, `AMBIGUOUS ANTECEDENTS`
