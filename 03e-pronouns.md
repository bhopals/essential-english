- Pronouns Improve flow, enabling the avoidance of repetitiveness at no cost of clarity.

  - Determining the right pronoun
  - Referring to the right antecedent
  - Ensuring that a pronoun agrees with its antecedent

## Determining the right pronoun

- Unlike nouns, pronouns change form depending on what role they play in a sentence.
- The different forms that a pronoun can take on are called cases.
- There are three cases:

- 1.  Subjective case
  - When a pronoun represents the subject, or actor.
  - Example
    - `I` will be late
- 2.  Objective case
  - It is used for a pronoun that represents the object, the entity affected by the action of the subject.
  - Example
    - Don't wait for `me`.
- 3.  Possessive case
  - It is used to indicate ownership, and differs depending on whether the pronoun precedes or follows the possessed object
  - Example
    - That's `my` soup.
    - The soup is `mine`.

### PERSONAL PRONOUNS

- Personal pronouns are used as stand-ins for the names of specific people or things.

- The SUBJECTIVE PERSONAL PRONOUNS are - `I`, `you`, `he`, `she`, `it`, `we`, and `they`
- These are used when the pronoun represents the subject of the sentence - the actor or the focus of interest.

- The OBJECTIVE PERSONAL PRONOUNS are - `me`, `you`, `him`, `her`, `it`, `us`, and `them`
- These are used when the pronoun represents the object of the sentence - something that is acted or affected by the subject.

- The POSSESSIVE PERSONAL PRONOUNS are - `mine`, `yours`, `hers`, `its`, `ours`, and `theirs`.
- These are used to define who owns something.

- CONFUSION BETWEEN the SUBJECT and OBJECTIVE CASES ARE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS:

  - 1. When the sentence has more than one subject.

    - `Sarah and me` bought some shoes (INCORRECT)
    - `Sarah and I` bought some shoes (CORRECT)

  - 2. When the sentence has more than one object

    - Examples
      - If you have any questions, please let Sara and `I` know (INCORRECT)
      - If you have any questions, please let Sara and `me` know (CORRECT)
    - This type of error is particularly likely to occur when the pronoun is the
      object of a preposition rather than the object of a verb.
    - The OBJECTIVE CASE is always required when a pronoun follows a preposition
      - give that `to me`
      - she went to the appointment `with him`
    - If another OBJECT intervenes between the preposition and pronoun, the subjective case may be mistakenly used.
      - The news came as a shock `to Sam and I`. (INCORRECT)
      - The news came as a shock `to Sam and me`. (CORRECT)

  - 3. When the pronoun is immediately followed by the noun it represents
