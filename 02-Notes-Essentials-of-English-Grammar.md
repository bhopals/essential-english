## Sentences and Sentences Pattern

- Sentence

  - A Sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
  - It begins with a Capital Letter and closes with an end mark, either a PERIOD(.) or a QUESTION MARK(?) or EXCLAMATION MARK(!).
  - Sentences are classified as four types:
    - DECLARATIVE - We reached the final level of Doom.
    - INTERROGATIVE - How did you get past the Valley of Fire?
    - IMPERATIVE - Click on Dragon. Watch out for the Black Guard.
    - EXCLAMATORY - I'm in the Secret Chamber!

- Fragment

  - Not every group of words is a Sentence.
  - A fragment is a phrase or clause that looks like a sentence but does not express a complete thought.
  - Example
    - down by the river where the fish bite
    - if he would just think
  - By themselves, fragments make little sense and leave important question unanswered.
    - Corrected Version of the Fragment by making it a full sentence
      - We were down by the river where the fish bite.
      - How could he save himself so much trouble if he would just think.

- Run-ons
  - Unlike fragments, which have not enough parts to make a complete sentence, run-ons have too many parts.
  - They are two or more complete thoughts - at time only vaguely related - strung together without punctuations.
  - Example (Run-ons version)
    - We have only three days until the trip starts I don't have my jacket repaired yet and that will take at least
      a day or so to do don't you think
  - Example (Corrected version)
    - We have only three days until the trip starts, and I forgot to have my jacket repaired. Do you think the repairs
      will take more than a day or so?
    - We have only three days to get ready for the trip. I forgot to have my jacket repaired. Do you think the repairs will
      take more than a day or so?

### Phrases and Clauses

- The various parts of speech are grouped into phrases and clauses, which make up the basic sentence.
- Phrases

  - Phrases are groups of related words that do not contain a subject-verb combination or express a complete thought.
  - There are noun phrases, prepositional phrases, participal phrases, verb phrases, and infinitive phrases.
  - Example
    - Noun - my widescreen TV, the tired old man
    - Prepositional - over the wall, around the clock
    - Participial - playing the fool, running the program
    - Verb - will be given, is coming
    - Infinitive - to think, to draw

- Clauses

  - Clauses are groups of related words that contain a subject-verb combination.
  - Independent Clauses express a complete thought and can stand by themselves as sentences.
  - Subordinate Clauses serves as part of a sentence but do not express a complete thought and cannot stand by themselves.
    They are subordinate to independent clauses

  - Example
    - Independent Clauses (Incorrect Version)
      - the floodplain was completely underwater
      - John got us jobs as stagehands
      - they took the off-road trail
    - Subordinate Clauses (Incorrect Version)
      - by the time June arrived
      - because he works at the theater
      - when they came to the turn
    - Complete Sentence
      - By the time June arrived, the floodplain was completely underwater.
      - John got us jobs as stagehands, because he works at the theater.
      - When they came to the turn, they took the off-road trail

### Subject and Predicate

- The Subject is the person, place, or thing that is the topic of the sentence.
- The Predicate is what is said about the subject and it always contains a VERB
- Example
  - The balloon (Subject) floated up through the trees (Predicate).
  - New York City (Subject) is a major cultural center (Predicate).
  - The Zoo Worker (Subject) was attacked by a tiger (Predicate).

### Sentence Constructions

- Simple Sentence
  - The Simple Sentence is an independent clause with no subordinate clause
  - Example
    - I bought four apples at the farmers market.
- Compound Sentence
  - The Compound Sentence contains two or more independent clauses but no subordinate clauses.
  - The Two independent clauses usually are joined by a comma followed by a conjuction(and, but, nor, yet)
  - Example
    - I don't know where he went, and no one has seen him since this afternoon.
    - You must have heard the news: we're all getting bonuses this year!
- Complex Sentence

  - The Complex Sentence is made up of an independent clause and one or more subordinate clauses.
  - When a Subordinate clauses introduces the sentence, it is usually followed by a Comma unless it is very short.
  - Example

    - The library closes early in Summer when the students are out of the school.

- Compound-Compound Sentence

  - The Compound-Complex Sentence is composed of two or more independent clauses and one or more subordinate clauses.
  - Example

    - He should call you as soon as he arrives; but if you don't hear from him, let me know.

### Modifier In Sentence

- A Modifier is any words or group of words that limits or qualify the meaning of other parts of the sentence.
- Be sure that your modifiers are clearly joined to the word or words they qualify.
- Descriptive phrases or clauses joined to the wrong words are known as "Dangling Modifiers".
