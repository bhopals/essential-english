  - STEPS

    - Go backward. Say the end of the word, and then add one letter at a time until you can say the whole thing

  - Example - A Russion Word `vzdrognu`
    - `nu` ==> `gnu` ==> `ognu` ==> `rognu` ==> `drognu` ==> `zdrongu` ==> `vzdrognu`
  - Back Chaining means, start from the end and keep adding one sound at a time.
    Then try the sound, once comfortable, add another, and keep going.

- TRAIN YOUR EARS
  - We should be good at internalizing patterns
