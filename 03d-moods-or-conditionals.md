## Moods (Conditional)

- `Indicative`, `imperative`, `subjunctive` and `infinitive` are the four moods of English verbs.
  All manners and moods are expressed through these four verbs.

- 1. Infinitive Mood

  - Verbs in the infinitive mood are used as parts of speech more than verbs. It expresses being or action.
  - Examples
    - I may go `to the beach` later.
    - They came `to speak` to me.
    - It's important `to eat` well.

- 2. Indicative Mood

  - We use the indicative mood to express `assertion`, `denial`, and `question`
  - Examples
    - Heathrow is the world's busiest airport.(Assertion)
    - Oliver cannot speak English. (Denial)
    - Do you work in the city? (Question)

- 3. Imperative Mood

  - We use the imperative mood to express `requests`, `commands` and `advice`/`instructions`
  - The subject of the sentence always understood to be `YOU`
  - It always uses the base form of the verb
  - Examples
    - Please don't talk in lesson. (Request)
    - Look out! (Advice)
    - Shut that door. (Command)

- 4. Subjunctive/Conditional Mood

  - We use the subjunctive mood to express `unreal situations`, `possibility` and `wish`.
  - Examples
    - If I were rich, I would buy a sports car.(Unreal)
    - We might find her ring if we were to look hard enough.(Possibility)
    - I wish it would stop raining.(Wish)

## Conditional Statmentss (Subjunctive/Conditional Mood)

- A conditional sentence contain two clauses.
  - One of these, `the condition clause`, presents a condition.
  - The other `result clause`, presents a result that is dependent on that condition.
- The condition clause includes a word such as `if`, `when`, or `unless`.
- Usually the clause that describes the `condition` comes `first` and the `result` clause comes `second`,
  but either order is possible

### Real Conditions

- A real conditonal describes that really does not exist or did exist under certain circumstances, or that is
  likely to or expected to exist.

#### Real conditional in the PRESENT

- Describes routine or habitual acts. The verbs in both clauses take the `SIMPLE PRESENT TENSE` (BASE FORM),
  consistent with the first application of this tense.

- if/when/unless + PRESENT SIMPLE (Conditional Clause), PRESENT SIMPLE (Result Clause).
- PRESENT SIMPLE (Result Clause) if/when/unless + PRESENT SIMPLE (Conditional Clause).

- Examples
  - If I `see` a spider in the house, I `squash` it. / I squash a spider if I see it in the hose.
  - When he `falls` off his bike, he `climbs` right back on it. / He climbs right back on his bike if he falls of it.
  - Unless she `gets` her way, she always `throws` a tanturum. / She always throws a tantrum unless she gets her way.

#### Real conditional in the PAST

- Describe something that once was routinely or repeatedly done, but carries and implication that it is no longer done.
- Again, the `condition clause` contains a word such as `if` or `when`, and the `result clause` contains
  a qualifying adverb such as `always`, `often`, or `usually`
- The verb in both clauses take `SIMPLE PAST TENSE` (PAST FORM)

- if/when/unless + PAST SIMPLE (Conditional Clause), always/often/usually PAST SIMPLE (Result Clause).
- Examples
  - If I `went` into town, I `always gave` my neighbours a lift.
  - When we `called` the dogs, they `usually came` running.

#### Real conditional in the FUTURE

- Describes something that can realistically happen in the future.
- Both clauses in this case describes specific acts that have not yet happened, but only the verb
  that states the result or outcome uses the SIMPLE FUTURE tense (WILL + BASE FORM)
- The verb that states the condition, despite the fact that it too is describing a future event,
  use the SIMPLE PRESENT tense (BASE FORM)
- IF/WHEN/UNLESS + PRESENT SIMPLE (CONDITIONAL Clause), SUBJECT + SIMPLE FUTURE
- SUBJECT + SIMPLE FUTURE + IF/WHEN/UNLESS + PRESENT SIMPLE (CONDITIONAL Clause)
- Examples
  - If you `fall`, I w`ill catch` you.
  - Unless you `object`, I `will invite` my parents to move in with us.
  - He `will call` you back if he `can`.

### Unreal Conditions

- An unreal conditional describes a hypothetical situation that
  DOES NOT NOW EXIST, NEVER EXISTED, or IS UNLIKELY TO EVER EXIST.

- Unreal conditionals can be set in the PRESENT
  - If a certain hypothetical result CONDITION EXISTED at this time, then a HYPHOTICAL RESULT would also now exist.
- In the PAST
  - If a certail htphotical CONDITIONS HAD EXISTED, then a HYPHOTICAL RESULT would also have EXISTED.
- In the FUTURE
  - If a certain hypothetical result CONDITION comes true at some later time, then a HYPHOTICAL RESULT
    will come true as well
- Unreal Conditions employ the auxiliary verbs `would`, `could`, `should`, and `might` among others.
  Such verbs are called MODALS, meaning that they modify the MOOD of the action verb.
  Just like INDICATIVE MOOD, they can take
  - Simple form (I would do)
  - Progressive form (I would be doing)
  - Perfect form (I have have done)
  - Perfect Progressive form (I would have been doing)

### Unreal conditional in the PRESENT

- Describes a scenario whereby `if` hypothetical event A (the condition) existed at the time,
  then a hyphotical event B (the result) would folow.

  - Example
    - If I `lived` downtown, I `would bike` to work. [but I don't live]
    - If I knew what was wrong, I would fix it. [but I don't know]
    - If she had any brain, she would see what he was up to [too bad she does not]
    - If I had a hammer, I would hammer in the morning. [but I don't have one, so world peace will have to wait :D]

- A number of constructions for unreal present conditional sentences are presented below.

  - 1. Conditional sentences with no explicit `if` clause

    - A conditional sentence does not have to contain an explicit if clause; the if can be implied.
    - Example
      - (If) A law that `required` recently licensed drivers to have no more than one passenger
        under the age of nineteen `would reduce` the number of vehicle accidents involving teenagers.

  - 2. Conditional sentences with progressive verbs

    - Conditional sentences can contain verbs in the progressive form, to indicate a hypothetical event that,
      if true, would be ongoing at this time. A PROGRESSIVE VERB in the `if` clause takes the PAST PROGRESSIVE Form
      while the verb in the result clause takes the conditional simple, formed by would plus the base form of the
      action verb
    - If/When/Unless + PAST PROGRESSIVE, SUBJECT + Would + PRESENT SIMPLE
    - Examples
      - If they `were living` together, they `would save` a lot of money. [too bad they can't stand each other]
    - If the progressive verb is in the result clause, it takes the conditional progressive, formed by would
      be plus the present participle of the action verb. The verb in the IF clause takes the SIMPLE PAST.
    - Examples
      - If he `understood` the urgency, I am sure he `would be helping` you. [but he does not so you are on your own]
      - If I `had` the energy, I `would be tidying` the house right now. [No enery now, so may be next week]

  - use of `was` versus `were` in the subjunctive. For the `if` clause, a garmmatical quirk associated with the
    subjunctive is that when it is applied to the verb `to be`, the past form for the first and third person.
    (I `was`, he `was`, she `was`, it `was`) ==> All CHANGES to `WERE` (I `were`, he `were`, she `were`, it `were`)

    - Examples

      - Perhaps this software would work if the moon `were` in the right phase.
      - If here `were` younger, it would be a different story.
      - He treats his girlfriend as if she `were` a child.
      - If I `were` you, I would .... [insert helpful advise of choise here]

    - It is common error to use `was` in such sentences (If I `was` younger, If I `was` you) - INCORRECT

### Unreal conditional in the PAST

- Describes some hypothetical event that did not in fact ever happen, but if it had happened,
  then a hypothetical result would have followed.
- Unlike the real conditional in the present, which allows for the possibility that the hypothetical event
  might later come true, in this case it is too late and fulfillment is IMPOSSIBLE.
- Conditional Sentences in the past are the HYPHOTICAL equivalent of the past perfect tense, which states that
  actual event A occured before actual event B occured.
  In this case, the message is that if hypothetical event A had occured at a certain time, then
  hypothetical event B would have resulted.
  The verb in the `if` clause (`Conditions`) takes the PAST PERFECT TENSE (`had` + PAST Participle), and the
  verb in the `result` clause takes the CONDITIONAL PERFECT (Would have + PAST PARTICIPLE)
- Examples

  - If I `had known` you were coming, I `would have baked` a cake.
  - If he `had listened` to his mother, he `would have applied` to medical school.
  - If she `had realized` that the tiara that had been left to her was set with genuine diamonds,
    she `would not have sold` it for tow dollars at the garage sale.

- A number of other constructions for unreal past conditional sentences are presented below:

  - 1. Conditional sentences with no explicit `if` clause
    - A conditional sentence does not have to have an explicit `if` clause:
      - Example
        - In hindsight, he realized it `would have been` a good idea to drill drainage holes in
          the planters before mounting them on the balcony railing.
  - 2. Conditional sentences with Progressive Verbs

    - As with the conditional in the present, these sentences can contain verbs in the PROGRESSIVE form,
      to indicate something ongoing. A PROGRESSIVE VERB in the `if` clause takes the past perfect progressive,
      while that in the result clause take the conditional perfect, formed by the auxiliary verbs would have
      plust the past participle of the action verb.
    - Examples

      - If I `had been paying` more attention, I `would have stopped`
        the hairdresser before he applied the airplance glue.
      - If they `had been sleeping` at the time, they `would never have heard` the bear going through the garbage.

    - If the progressive verb is in the result clause, it takes the conditional perfect progressive, formed by
      the auxiliary verbs` would have been + the present progressive`, formed the auxiliary verbs
      `would have been + present participle` of the action verb.
      The verb in the `if` clause takes the `past perfect`.

      - Examples
        - If she `had married` her elderly admirer, she `would have been living` in the lap of luxury.
          [big mistake that she went instead for the handsome young artist]
        - You` would not have been laughing` if it `had happened` to you. [A little empathy would be nice]
        - If we had missed that bus, we `would have been waiting` for the next one for an hour.
          [good thing I mase us run for it.]

  - 3. Use of the correct participle with irregular verbs
    - A common error in the construction is to use the `past form` (Second form) of the verb
      instead of the `past participle` (Third form)
    - The following examples are INCORRECT
      - I `would have went` if you `had asked` me to [should be - I `would have gone`]
      - If I `had not stopped` her, she `would have drank` the whole thing.
        [should be - she `would have drunk`]
      - You could not possible `have wrote` that yourself.
        [should be - you could not possibly `have written` that yourself]

### Unreal conditional in the FUTURE

- Describe a hypothetical event in the future where the intention is to emphasize that fulfillment of the event
  is uncertain, unlikely or impossible.
- The verb in the `if` clause takes the conditional simple (would + base form) of the action verb.
- Example (Unlikely / Impossible)
  - I may have to make a business trip to Tokyo. Wow that sounds exciting - if you `went`, when `would` you `go`?
- Example (If the trip were given, this would be worded as `When will you go`)
  - I may have to make a business trip to Tokyo. Wow that sounds exciting - if you `went`, when `will` you `go`?
- Example (Unlikely / Impossible)
  - If I had time next week, I would clean the garage. [I won't have time so it wont be done]
- Example (likely situation)
  -If I have time, I will clean the garage

- One or both clauses can take progressive form instead of the simple form:
  - If I `were going` your way, I `would give` you a lift.
  - If he `were graduating` in time, he `would be joining` you at the firm this year.
  - If I `were not playing `darts tonight, I `would gladly join` you in the game of chess.
