## Moods (Conditional)

- `Indicative`, `imperative`, `subjunctive` and `infinitive` are the four moods of English verbs.
  All manners and moods are expressed through these four verbs.

- 1. Infinitive Mood

  - Verbs in the infinitive mood are used as parts of speech more than verbs. It expresses being or action.
  - Examples
    - I may go `to the beach` later.
    - They came `to speak` to me.
    - It's important `to eat` well.

- 2. Indicative Mood

  - We use the indicative mood to express `assertion`, `denial`, and `question`
  - Examples
    - Heathrow is the world's busiest airport.(Assertion)
    - Oliver cannot speak English. (Denial)
    - Do you work in the city? (Question)

- 3. Imperative Mood

  - We use the imperative mood to express `requests`, `commands` and `advice`/`instructions`
  - The subject of the sentence always understood to be `YOU`
  - It always uses the base form of the verb
  - Examples
    - Please don't talk in lesson. (Request)
    - Look out! (Advice)
    - Shut that door. (Command)

- 4. Subjunctive/Conditional Mood

  - We use the subjunctive mood to express `unreal situations`, `possibility` and `wish`.
  - Examples
    - If I were rich, I would buy a sports car.(Unreal)
    - We might find her ring if we were to look hard enough.(Possibility)
    - I wish it would stop raining.(Wish)

## Conditional Statmentss (Subjunctive/Conditional Mood)

- A conditional sentence contain two clauses.
  - One of these, `the condition clause`, presents a condition.
  - The other `result clause`, presents a result that is dependent on that condition.
- The condition clause includes a word such as `if`, `when`, or `unless`.
- Usually the clause that describes the `condition` comes `first` and the `result` clause comes `second`,
  but either order is possible

### Real Conditions

- A real conditonal describes that really does not exist or did exist under certain circumstances, or that is
  likely to or expected to exist.

#### Real conditional in the PRESENT

- Describes routine or habitual acts. The verbs in both clauses take the `SIMPLE PRESENT TENSE` (BASE FORM),
  consistent with the first application of this tense.

- if/when/unless + PRESENT SIMPLE (Conditional Clause), PRESENT SIMPLE (Result Clause).
- PRESENT SIMPLE (Result Clause) if/when/unless + PRESENT SIMPLE (Conditional Clause).

- Examples
  - If I `see` a spider in the house, I `squash` it. / I squash a spider if I see it in the hose.
  - When he `falls` off his bike, he `climbs` right back on it. / He climbs right back on his bike if he falls of it.
  - Unless she `gets` her way, she always `throws` a tanturum. / She always throws a tantrum unless she gets her way.

#### Real conditional in the PAST

- Describe something that once was routinely or repeatedly done, but carries and implication that it is no longer done.
- Again, the `condition clause` contains a word such as `if` or `when`, and the `result clause` contains
  a qualifying adverb such as `always`, `often`, or `usually`
- The verb in both clauses take `SIMPLE PAST TENSE` (PAST FORM)

- if/when/unless + PAST SIMPLE (Conditional Clause), always/often/usually PAST SIMPLE (Result Clause).
- Examples
  - If I `went` into town, I `always gave` my neighbours a lift.
  - When we `called` the dogs, they `usually came` running.

#### Real conditional in the FUTURE

- Describes something that can realistically happen in the future.
- Both clauses in this case describes specific acts that have not yet happened, but only the verb
  that states the result or outcome uses the SIMPLE FUTURE tense (WILL + BASE FORM)
- The verb that states the condition, despite the fact that it too is describing a future event,
  use the SIMPLE PRESENT tense (BASE FORM)
- IF/WHEN/UNLESS + PRESENT SIMPLE (CONDITIONAL Clause), SUBJECT + SIMPLE FUTURE
- SUBJECT + SIMPLE FUTURE + IF/WHEN/UNLESS + PRESENT SIMPLE (CONDITIONAL Clause)
- Examples
  - If you `fall`, I w`ill catch` you.
  - Unless you `object`, I `will invite` my parents to move in with us.
  - He `will call` you back if he `can`.

### Unreal Conditions

- An unreal conditional describes a hypothetical situation that
  DOES NOT NOW EXIST, NEVER EXISTED, or IS UNLIKELY TO EVER EXIST.

- Unreal conditionals can be set in the PRESENT
  - If a certain hypothetical result CONDITION EXISTED at this time, then a HYPHOTICAL RESULT would also now exist.
- In the PAST
  - If a certail htphotical CONDITIONS HAD EXISTED, then a HYPHOTICAL RESULT would also have EXISTED.
- In the FUTURE
  - If a certain hypothetical result CONDITION comes true at some later time, then a HYPHOTICAL RESULT
    will come true as well
- Unreal Conditions employ the auxiliary verbs `would`, `could`, `should`, and `might` among others.
  Such verbs are called MODALS, meaning that they modify the MOOD of the action verb.
  Just like INDICATIVE MOOD, they can take
  - Simple form (I would do)
  - Progressive form (I would be doing)
  - Perfect form (I have have done)
  - Perfect Progressive form (I would have been doing)
