## Prepositions

- Prepositions relate nouns or pronouns to other words in a sentence.
  - Examples - `about`, `at`, `down`, `for`, `of`, `with`
- They never change their form, regardless of the case, gender etc. of the word they are referring to.
- A preposition in one language might have several translations depending on the situation.
