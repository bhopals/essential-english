## Prepositions

- Prepositions relate nouns or pronouns to other words in a sentence.
  - Examples - `about`, `at`, `down`, `for`, `of`, `with`
- They never change their form, regardless of the case, gender etc. of the word they are referring to.
- A preposition in one language might have several translations depending on the situation.

### Classification of Prepositions

- Prepositions are classified as SIMPLE or COMPOUND

- A. Simple Prepositions
  - Simple prepositions are single word prepositions
  - Example
    - The book is `on` the table.
- B. Compound Prepositions

  - Compound prepositions are made up of more than one word.
    - `in between` and `because of` are prepositions made up of two words.
    - `in front of` and `on behalf of` are prepositions made up of three words.

### Degree of Comparison

- Adjectives have three degrees of comparison.
- These three degrees of comparison show relationships between or among the words they modify.
- Threes Types of Degree - POSITIVE, COMPARATIVE, SUPERLATIVE
- TYPES
  - POSITIVE DEGREE
    - Expresses a quality without a comparison; a statement is made concerning only one entity.
    - Examples
      - The tree is `tall`.
      - The grass is `green`.
      - The water is `cold`.
  - COMPARATIVE DEGREE
    - Expresses a degree higher or lower than the positive. It is used to compare two things, and the
      inflectional suffix is usually `er`

      - She is `younger` of the two sisters.
      - She sings `better` than anyone else in the choir.

    - Examples
      - Susan is the `brightest` of all the students in class.
      - Carl is the `nimblest` player on the team.
      - That was the `most beautiful` sunset I have ever seen.
