## English Grammar for the Utterly Confused (Laurie Rozakis)

- ADJECTIVES - What Kind?, How Many?, Which Thing?, Which One?, What Kind?
- ADVERBS - How?, Where?, When?, Why?, In what Manner?, To what extent

## Chapter 1 - Part of Speech

### Adjectives

- Adjectives are words that describe nouns and pronouns.
- Adjective answers the questions:

  - What kind? - "red" nose, "gold" ring
  - How Much? - "more" sugar, "little" effort
  - Which One? - "second" chance, "those" chocolates
  - How Many? - "several" chances, "six" books

- There are five kinds of adjectives

  - Common Adjectives

    - Describes Nouns and pronouns
    - Example - "Strong" Man, "Green" Apple

  - Proper Adjective

    - Formed for Proper Nouns
    - Example - "Mexican" Food, "Indian" Curry

  - Compound Adjective

    - Made up of more than one word
    - Example - "far-off" country, "teenage" person

  - Articles

    - Articles are a special type of adjectives.
    - There are three articles: a, an, the
    - "the" is called "definite article" because it refers to specific thing
    - "a, an" are called "indefinite articles" because they refers to general things
    - Use "a" with constant sounds and "an" with vowel sound

  - Indefinite Adjective
    - Don't specify the specific amount of something
    - Example - all, another, any, both, each, either, few, many, more, most, neither, other, several, some

- RULE: Follow these guidelines when you use adjectives

  - Use an adjective to describe a noun or a pronoun
    - Example - Jesse(noun) was "willing" (adj) to leave "the"(adj) circus(noun)
  - Use vivid adjectives to make your writing more specific and descriptive
    - Example - Take a "larger"(adj) slice (noun) of the "luscious" (ajd) cake (noun)
  - Use an adjective after a linking verb. A linking verb connects a subject with a descriptive word.
    - The most common Linking Verbs are be(is, am, are, was, were, and so on), seem, appear, look, feel, smell, sound,
      taste, become, grow, remain, stay, and turn
    - Example - Chicken made this way "tastes" more "delicious"

- TIP:
  - Predicate Adjectives are adjectives separated from the noun and pronoun by a linking verb.
  - Predicate Adjectives describes the subject of the sentence
  - Example - The weather was cold all week

### Adverbs

- Adverbs are words that describes verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
- Adverbs answer the questions:
  - When? - left yesterday, begin now
  - Where? - fell below, move up
  - How? - happily sang, danced badly
  - To What extent? - partly finished, eat completely
- More Adverbs are formed by adding -ly to an adjective

  - Qucik - Quickly
  - Careful - Carefully
  - Accurate - Accurately

- RULE

  - Use an adverb to describe a verb

    - Example - Experiments using dynamite must be done(verb) "carefully (adv)"

  - Use an adverb to describe a adjective

    - Example - Sam had an "unbelievably(adv) huge(adj)" appetite for chips

  - Use an adverb to describe a adverb
    - Example - The sang "so(adv) clearly(adv)"

### Conjuctions

- Conjuctions connect the words or group of words

- There are three kind of conjunction:

  - Coordinate conjunction

    - link similar words or work groups
    - for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so (FANBOYS)

  - Correlative Conjuctions

    - link similar words and word groups
    - but they are always used in pairs
    - both...and, either...or, neither...nor, not only...but also, whether...or

  - Subordinating Conjuctions
    - link and independent clause (complete sentence) to a dependent clause (fragment).
    - after, although, as, as if
    - as long as, as soon as, as though, because
    - before, even though, if, in order that
    - since, so that, though, till
    - unless, until, when, whenever, where, wherever

### Interjections

- Interjections show strong emotions
- Since interjections are not linked gramatically to other words in the sentence, they are set off from the rest of
  the sentence with a comma or an exclamation mark.
- oh!, wow!

## Chapter 2 - Using Pronouns Correctly

- A Pronoun is a word used in a place of a noun or another noun.
- A Pronoun gets its meaning from the noun it replaces, called the "antecedent".
- Pronoun
  - Nominative Pronoun - The Pronoun is used as a subject.(I, You, He, She, It, We, They Who, Whoever)
  - Objective Pronoun - The Pronoun is used as a object. (Me, You, Him, Her, It, Us, Them, Whom, Whomever)
  - Possessive Pronoun - The Pronoun is used to show ownership. (My or Mine, Your or Yours, His, Her or Hers, Our or Ours, Their or Theirs, Whose, Whosever)

### Nominative Pronoun / Use the Nominative Case

- Use the Nominative Case to show the Subject of a Verb.
  - Ex1 - Father and "I" like to shop at flea Market
  - Ex2 - "I" like to shop at flea markets.
- Use the Nominative Case for a Predicative Nominative.
  - A Predicative Nominative is a Noun or Pronoun that follows a linking verb and identifies or renames the subject.
  - Remember that a Linking Verb connects a subject to a word that renames it. Linking Verbs indicate
    a state of being (am, is, are, etc.), relate to the senses (look, smell, taste, etc.), or indicate a condition (appear, seems, become, etc..)
  - Ex1 - The salesman of the month was "I". (Sometimes Objective nominative "Me" can also be used)

### Objective Pronoun / Use the Objective Case

- Use the Objective case to show a Direct Object
  - A Direct Object is a noun or pronoun that receives the action.
    - Ex1 - John's suit no longer fits "him".
    - Ex2 - "Whom" did she finally invite to the party.
- Use the Objective case to show an Indirect Object
  - An Indirect Object tells to or for whom something is done.
  - Ex1 - The bill gave "us" a shock
- Use the Objective case for the Object of a Preposition.
  - Ex1 - Sit by "me"

### Possessive Pronoun / Use the Possessive Case

- Use the Possessive case to show ownership.
  - Ex1 - The Child refused to believe that the sweater was "hers".
- Use the Possessive case before gerunds.
  - Ex1 - "Your" walking (gerund) in the rain didn't cause your cold.
- Use some possessive pronouns alone to show ownership.
  - Ex1 - The cell phone is "mine", not "yours"

## RULES - To Use correct Pronoun Reference

- 1. A Pronoun must clearly refer to a single antecendent. A common writing and speech problem occurs when the same
     pronoun refers to more than one antecendent. Remember a PRONOUN replaces a NOUN so always use the NOUN first
     before you use the pronouns.

     - Example (Incorrect Sentence)
       - Guilt and unkindness can be emotionally destructive to you and your friends. You must get rid of "them".
     - Example (Corrected Sentence)
       - Guilt and unkindness can be emotionally destructive to you and your friends. You must get rid of "these issues".
       - Guilt and unkindness can be emotionally destructive to you and your friends. You must get rid of "these destructive emotions"

- 2. Place Pronouns close to their antecendents.

     - Example (Incorrect Sentence)
       - After meeting with a few guests, the President entered the reception. At that point, Senator Chin and the other
         elected officials began to pose for Pictures. Even so, "he" did not join.
     - Example (Corrected Sentence)
       - After meeting with a few guests, the President entered the reception. At that point, Senator Chin and the other
         elected officials began to pose for Pictures. Even so, "the President" did not join.
       - After meeting with a few guests, the President entered the reception. He did not join Senator Chin and the other
         elected officials, even they have began to pose for Pictures.

3. Make a Pronoun refer to a definite antecedent. Be sure all pronouns refer to only one antecedent.
   - Example (Incorrect Sentence)
     - I told my friends that I was going to be a rockstar, which annoyed my mother.
   - Example (Corrected Sentence)
     - My mother was annoyed because I told my friends that I was going to be a rockstar.

### The Generic Masculine Pronoun

- Pronouns have Number, Person, and Gender.
- Example
  - A Student should turn in his assignments on time. (Masculine - Male)
  - A Student should turn in her assignments on time. (Feminini - Female)
  - Students should turn in their assignments on time. (Gender Neutral - Preferred one)

### Using WHO, WHICH, THAT

- WHO refers to people or animals
- THAT or WHICH refers to things, groups, and unnammed animals
  - The choise between WHICH and THAT depends of whether the clause introduced by the pronoun is RESTRICTIVE or NONRESTRICTIVE.
  - A Restrictive clause is essential to the sentence.
  - Use "That" for Restrictive and "Which" with nonrestrictive clauses.

### SUMMARY

- Case is the form of Noun or Pronoun that shows how it is used in a sentence.
- English has three cases: Nominative, Objective, and Possessive.
- Use the Nominative Case to show Subject of a verb.
- Use the Objective Case to show the Object of a verb.
- Use the Possessive Case to show Ownership.
- Make a Pronoun clearly refer to a single, definite antecedent.
- Place Pronouns close to their antecedents.

## Chapter 3 - Using Verbs Correctly

- Verbs are words that name an action or describe a state of being.
- There are four basic types - Action Verbs, Linking Verbs, Helping Verbs, and Verb Phrases.

- Regular Verbs

  - The past tense and past participle forms are created by adding -d, -ed, or -t to the Present form, but the vowel does not change.
  - Example
    - Walk, Walked, Walked

- Irregular Verbs

  - No pattern is followed when the past and past participle are formed.
  - Example
    - Begin, Began, Begun
    - Lose, Lost, Lost
    - Run, Run, Run
    - Lie, Lay, Lain
    - Lay, Laid, Laid

### Tenses

- PRESENT

  - Use Simple Present and Present Progressive to show events that take place now.

- PAST

  - Use SIX pasts forms to show the events that took place before the present.

  - 1. Simple Past

    - Completed Action (Indefinite Time) - We washed the car.
    - Completed Condition (Indefinite Time) - We were happy that the party was over.
    - Completed Action (Definite Time) - We washed the car yesterday.
    - Completed Condition (Definite Time) - I was delighted yesterday to receive the news.

  - 2. Present Perfect

    - Completed Action (Indefinite Time) - We have bought the gifts.
    - Completed Condition (Indefinite Time) - I have been very relieved.
    - Action Continuing into the Present - Sarah has called for two hours.
    - Condition Continuing into the Present - She has been in New York for a week.

  - 3. Past Perfect
    - Condition Completed before another - Greg had called all his friends before the party started.
    - Condition Completed - Greg had been a buther, before he became a guru.
  - 4. Past Progressive
    - Continuous Completed Action - I was attending a Spa that month.
  - 5. Present Perfect Progressive
    - Action Continuing into Present - Ralph has been exercising all week.
  - 6. Past Perfect Progressive
    - Continuing action interrupted by another - Katie had been reparing the fence that was damaged in the storm.

- FUTURE
  - Use the FOUR future forms to show events that take place in the future.
  - 1. Simple Future
    - Future Action - The bus will arrive.
    - Future Condition - I will be shocked when it does.
  - 2. Future Perfect
    - Future action completed before another - By the time you read this, the bus will have arrived.
    - Future condition completed before another - The storm will have been raging for an hour before the phone goes out.
  - 3. Future Progressive
    - Continuing future action - Janice will be exercising all summer.
  - 4. Future Perfect Progressive
    - Continuing future action completed before another - When we go on a vacation next week, I will have been exercising for a month.

### Active/Passive Voice

- Active Voice

  - A Verb is active when the subject performs the action.
  - Examples

    - I served a delicious meal.
    - We took the package home.

- Passive Voice

  - A Verb is passive when its action is performed upon the subject.
  - Examples
    - A package was taken home.
    - A delicious meal was served by me.

- RULES TO USE
  - In general, use the Active voice whenever possible because it is more direct and forceful.
  - Using the Active voice makes your writing more crisp and powerful.
  - The Active verb is one word rather than two.
  - Further, there is a no need for a prepositional phrase beginning with "by" if you use Active Voice.
  - USE of Passive Voice is preferable over the active voice under two conditions:
    - You don't want to assign blame.
      - Example - A mistake occurred with the filling system.
    - You don't know who did the action.
      - Example - A prank phone call was made at 02:00PM.

### SUMMARY

- A Verb's Tense shows when the action takes place. Use the right order of tenses to show the correct order of events.
- English verbs are divided into two classes: REGULAR and IRREGULAR.
- Voice shows the Subject acts (active voice) or is acted upon (passive voice).
  In general, use Active Voice instead of the Passive Voice.

## Chapter 4 - Using Adjectives and Adverbs Correctly

- Use an Adjective to describe a noun or pronoun.
- Use an Adverbs to describe a Verb, Adjective, or another Adverb.
- Use the Comparative degree to describe two items. (Ross is "richer" than Donald.)
- Use Superlative degree to describe three or more things. (Ross is the richest of all.)
- Comparative/superlative - more/most/less/least/other/else
- Be careful when you use an adjective after a linking verb.
  - Remember linking verb describes a state of being or a condition.
  - They include all forms to be (such as am, is, are, were, was)
    and verbs related to senses(look, smell, sound, feel)
  - Linking verbs connect the subject of a sentence to a word that renames or describes it.
- Avoid double negatives.

## Chapter 5 - Agreement: Matching Sentence Parts

- AGREEMENT means that sentence parts match. Subjects must AGREE with verbs, and pronouns must AGREE with antecedents (clause).
  If they don't, your sentences will sound awkward and may confuse your listeners and readers.
- A SUBJECT MUST AGREE with its VERB in NUMBER

### A Singular Subject Must have a Singular Verb

- A Singular Subject must have a Singular Verb.
  - Example - She "hesitates" at all intersections, making the other drivers angry.
- Two or more subjects joined by "or" or "nor"/ "neither" or "nor" must have a singular verb.
  - Example - Either the dog "or" cat has to go
- Subjects that are singular in meaning but plurals in form require a singular verb.

  - Example - The news "is" on very night at 11:00PM.

- Plural subjects that function as a single unit take a singular verb.
  - Example - Bacon and eggs "makes" a great late night snack.
  - Example - Spaghetti and meatballs is my favorite dish.
- Titles are always singular
  - Example - Stranger in a Strange Land was written by Robert.

### A Plural Subject Must have a Plural Verb

- A Plural subject must have a Plural Verb.
  - Example - Men "are" from Earth.
  - Example - On a average, People "fear" spiders.
- Two or more Plural Subjects joined by "or" or "nor" must have a plural verb.
  - Example - Either the children or the adults "are" clearing the table.
  - Example - Neither my relatives nor my friends "are" leaving anytime soon.
- A Compound Subject joined by AND is Plural and must have Plural verbs.
  - Example - Nina and Chris have donated money to charity.
- If TWO or more singular and plural subjects are joined by "or" or "nor", the subject closest to the verb determines agreement.
  - Its always best to match the VERB closer to the subject.
  - Example - Margery or the twins "are" coming on a trip to Seattle.
  - Example - The twins or Margery "is" coming on a trip to Seattle.

### Collective Nouns and Indefinite Pronouns

- Collective Nouns

  - A Collective noun names a group of people or things. - class, committee, flock, audience, team, club.
  - A Collective noun is considered singular when it functions as a single unit.
    - Example - The team "has" practiced for tonights big game for months.
  - A collective nouns is considered plural when the group it identifies is considered to be individuals.
    - Example - The team "have" practiced for tonights big game for months.

- Indefinite Pronouns

  - Like Collective nouns, indefinite pronouns refer to people, place, objects, or things - everyone, someone, all, more
  - Singular Indefinite pronouns take singular verb
    - another, anybody, anyone, anything, each, either, everybody, everything, little, many a
    - much, neither, nobody, no one, nothing, one, other, somebody, something, someone
  - Plural Indefinite pronouns take a plural verb
    - both, few, many others, several
  - Singular or Plural Indefinite Pronouns
    - all, any, more, most, none, some
  - Examples
    - One of the gerbils "is" missing.
    - Both of the gebrils "are" missing.
    - Many of the guests are sick of Tedious Ted's endless chatter.

### Special Problems in Agreement

- The rules for agreement are straightforward, but some thorny problems do arise. Here are the two most
  challenging issues: hard-to-find subjects, and intervening phrases.

- 1. Identify Hard-to-find subjects
  - Example
    - In the bottom of the lake "are" two old cars(subject)
    - There "were" still half a dozen tires(subject) in the lake
  - The Words "there" or "here" at the beginning of a sentence often signal INVERTED WORD ORDER.
- 2. Ignore intervening phrases
  - Disregard words or phrases that come between the subject and the verb.
  - A Phrase or Clause that comes between a subject and its verb does not affect subject-verb agreement.
  - Example
    - The strongest muscle in the body "is" tongue.
    - The captain of the guards "stands" at the door of Buckingham Palace.

### Agreement of Pronouns and Antecedents

- Like subjects and verbs, pronouns and antecedents (the word to which they refer) must agree.
- RULES

  - 1. A Pronoun agrees with its antecedent in number, person, and gender.
    - Example
      - Hortense gave half "her" cupcake to Shirley.
      - INCORRECT - Hortense will eat her bran flakes and tofu, which you need to stay healthy.
      - CORRECT - Hortense will eat her bran flakes and tofu, which "she" needs to stay healthy
  - 2. Use a singular personal pronoun with a singular indefinite pronoun.
    - Example - If anyone questions the edict, refer "him" or "her" to the boss
  - 3. Use a Plural Pronoun when the antecedents are joinded by "and". This is true even if the antecedents are singular
    - Example - The dog and cat maintain "their" friendship by staying out of each others way.
  - 4.  Antecedents joined by "or", "nor", or correlative conjuctions such as "either...or", "neither...nor" with the
        antecedents closer to the pronoun.
    - Example
      - Neither my baby sister or twins sleep in "their" bed.
      - Neither the twins or my baby sister sleep in "her" bed.
  - 5. Be sure that Pronoun refers directly to the noun.
    - Confusion occurs when the pronoun can refer to more than one antecedent.
    - If you end up with a confusion sentence, rewrite the sentences.
    - Example
      - CONFUSING - Norman saw a coupon in last year's newspaper, but he can't find it.
      - CORRECT - Norman can't find the coupon he saw in last year's newspaper.

### SUMMARY

- AGREEMENT means that sentence parts match.
- Subjects must agree with verbs, and pronouns must agree with antecedents.
- Find the sentence's subject. Figure out if the subject is singular or plural.
- Select the appropriate verb form to match the form of the subjects.

## Chapter 6 - The 25 Most Common Usage Problems

- 25 Common Errors - Grammar and Usage, Sentences, Spelling, Punctuation, Capitalization, Proofreading

### Most common Grammar and Usage Errors

- 1. Lack of Clarity

  - Example

    - INCORRECT SENTENCE
      - Prehistoric people used many inorganic substances difficult to find at archaeological sites, which inculded clay and rock.
    - CORRECT SENTENCE
      - Prehistoric people used many inorganic substances, including clay and rock, which are difficult to find at archaeological sites.

  - Sentence can be confusing for many different reasons. In the previous example, too many phrases come between the pronoun and its
    antecedents. As a result, the pronoun reference gets confusing. This can happen even if the intervening materials is logically
    related to the rest of the sentence, as is the case here.

  - Here is the quick and dirty lowdown (Check Chapter 7, 8, 9, and 13 for more details):
    - One Sentence = One Complete Thought. Don't cram too much into one sentence.
    - The more complex your ideas, the shorter and more simple your sentence should be.
    - Check that all parts of the sentence are logically related. Are they in the same TENCE?
    - ReRead your sentences to make sure all pronouns refer to their antecedents and are placed as close as possible to them.
    - Check that you have punctuated your sentence correctly.

- 2. Redundancy(unnecessary words)

  - INCORRECT SENTENCE
    - If you reread your work, you will find upon serious reconsideration that a great deal of repetition can be avoided by
      careful editing and revising and attentive reevaluation. Scrupulous editing can also help you make your writing less wordy.
  - CORRECT SENTENCE
    - If you reread your work, you will find that a great deal of repetition can be avoided by careful editing.
  - Long-winded writing may sound educated and impressivem but it actually turns off your audience because it wastes their time.
    Say what you need to say concisely. Since your writing will be more intelligent, it will communicate its message directly.

- 3. Problems with Subject-Verb Agreement

  - INCORRECT: Verbs has to agree with the subjects.
  - CORRECT: Verb have to agree with the subjects.
  - Agreement means that sentences parts match. Singular to Singular, and Plural to Plural.

- 4. Lack of Parallel Structure

  - NOT Parallel (Incorrect Version)
    - To avoid getting hit by lightning, never seek protection under a tree, lying down on wet ground, or staying on a bike.
  - CORRECT Version
    - To avoid getting hit by lightning, never seek protection under a tree, lie down on wet ground, or stay on a bike.

- 5. Wrong verb tenses

  - INCORRECT
    - President John Quincy Adams owns a pet alligator, which he kept in the East Room of the White House.
  - CORRECT
    - President John Quincy Adams owned a pet alligator, which he kept in the East Room of the White House.
  - Do not mix PAST and PRESENT. If the sentence is in PAST, use PAST Tense all over, and vice versa.

- 6. Mixed metaphors

  - INCORRECT
    - Take the bull by toe.
  - CORRECT
    - Take the bull by the horns.
  - Metaphors are "Figure of Speech" that compare two unlike things to explain the less familiar subject.
    You should not change anything. It should be said the way it is.

- 7. Dangling Modifiers

  - INCORRECT
    - Flying over the countryside, cars and houses looked like toys.
  - CORRECT
    - As we flew over the countryside, cars and houses looked like toys.
  - A Modifier is a word or phrase that describes a subject, verb, or objects.
    The Modifier is said to be DANGLE when the word it modifies has been left out of the sentence.
    Dangling modifiers confuse your readers and obscure your meaning because the sentence doesn't make sense.
  - Correct a dangling modifier by adding the word or words that have been left out.
    Here, the subject was added and flying was changed to flew so the sentence makes sense.

  - Dangling Participle
    - INCORRECT - Rushing to finish the paper, Bob's printer broke.
    - CORRECT - While Bob was rushing to finish the paper, his printer broke.
    - One way to tell whether the Participle is dangling is to put the clause with the participle right after the
      subject of the sentence.
      "Bob's printer rushing to finish the paper, broke."
      You can easily hear that it doesn't sound right, hence required to be fixed.

- 8. Misplaced Modifiers

  - INCORRECT
    - My Parents bought a kitten for my sister they call Pawas.
  - CORRECT
    - My Parents bought a kitten they call Pawas for my sister.
  - A Misplace modifier is a phrase, clause, or word placed too far from the noun or pornoun it describes.

- 9. Incorrect Idioms

  - INCORRECT
    - It's raining cats and puppies.
  - CORRECT
    - It's raining cats and dogs.
  - An IDIOM is an expression that has a figurative rather than literal meaning.
    These IDIOMs should not be changed and be used exactly the way they are spoken.

  - Same goes for any prepositional phrase / Idiomatic Prepositions.
    - INCORRECT
      - She talked under to him.

  - Active Voice
    - The executive attended the meeting.
  - Active voice is always preferred as the voice is clearer and more concise than the passive voice
  - You should only consider using PASSIVE voice in these two conditions:
    - To avoid placing blame
      - "A Mistake was made" rather than "You made a mistake".
    - To avoid identifying the doer of the action
      - "The letter was sent" rather than "Nicole sent the letter".

### Sentences

- 12. Fragments (incomplete sentence)

  - Fragment (Incorrect Version)
    - If you want to be clearly understood
  - CORRECT

  - Every Sentence must have THREE Things
    - 1. A Subject: the "doer" of the action. The subject will be noun or pornoun.
    - 2. A Verb: What the subject does.
    - 3. A complete thought.
  - So always ensure your Sentence Express a complete thought.

- 13. Run-ons (two sentences run together)

  - Run-on (Incorrect Version)
    - Daddy longlegs spiders are more poisonous than black widows, daddy longlegs spiders cannot bite humans because their
      jaws won't open wide enough.

  - A Run-on Sentence occurs when two complete sentences (Independent Clauses) are incorrectly joined. Sentence can only joined with
    coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, nor, for, so, yet) or a semicolon - A comma doesn't cut the mustard.(Check Chapter 8 for more details).

### Spelling

- A Phrase is a group of words that functions in a sentence as a single part of speech. A Phrase does not have a
  subject or a verb, so it cannot stand alone as an independent unit - it can function only as a part of speech.

### Overview of Clauses

- A clause is a group of words with its own subject and verb. Like Phrases, clauses enrich your written and oral expression
  by adding details and making your meaning more exact.
- Clauses also allow you to combine ideas to show their relationship. This adds logic and cohesion to your speech and writing.
- There are two types of clauses:

  - 1. INDEPENDENT Clauses (Main Clause)
    - It is a complete sentence because it has a subject and verb.
  - 2. DEPENDENT Clauses (Relative or Subordinate Clause)

### Dependent Clause

- It is a part of a sentence and does not express the complete thought, so it cannot stand alone.
- Dependent Clauses add additional details/information to the main clauses, but they are not necessary.
- Subordinating Conjuctions link an independent clause to a dependent clause. Each subordinating conjuction
  expresses a relationship between the dependent clauses and the independent clause.

  - SUBORDINATION CONJUCTIONS === RELATIONSHOP
  - unless, provided that, if, even if === Condition
  - because, as, as if === Reason
  - rather than, than, whether === Choise
  - though, although, even though, but === Contrast
  - where, wherever === Location
  - in order that, so, so that, that === Result, effect
  - while, once, when, since, as whenever, after, before, until, as soon === Time

- When a dependent clause introduced by a subordinating conjuction comes before the independent clause,
  the clauses are usually separated by a comma.

  - Example
    - When you are in Greece, you should visit the Parthenon.(Dependent Clause + Independent Clause)
    - You should visit Parthenon when you are in Greece. (Independent Clause + Dependent Clause)

- SUBORDINATING CLAUSES

  - There are three different kinds of subordinating clauses

    - 1. ADVERB Clause

      - An adverb clause is a Dependent Clause that describes a verb, adjectives, or other adverbs.
      - As with adverbs, an adverb clause answers these questions:
        - Where?
        - Why?
        - When?
        - To what extent?
        - Under what conditions?
        - In what manner?

    - You can place an adverb at the Begging, in the Middle, or at the End of a sentence
    - Examples

      - `Wherever Misty goes`, she leaves broken hearts behind. (Beginning)
      - Fritz liked the meal `more than Tish did` because she is a picky eater. (Middle)
      - Harvey wanted to change his appearance `because he was wanted for embezzlement`. (End)

    - 2. ADJECTIVE Clause

      - An adjective clause is a dependent clause that describes nouns and pronouns.
      - As with adjectives and adjective clauses answers these questions:
        - What kind?
        - Which one?
        - How many?
        - How much?
      - Most adjective clauses start with the pronouns: `who`, `whom`, `why`, `whose`, `which`, `that`, `when`,`where`.
      - Examples
        - The traffic is never ligh on the days `when I'm in a hurry`.
        - We selected the candidates `who were the best qualified for the job`.

    - Use `who`, `whom` (and all variations such as `whoever`, `whomever`) to refer to PEOPLE.
    - Use `which` and `that` if the antecedent is a THING or an ANIMAL.

    - 3. RELATIVE Clause

      - Adjective clauses that begin with one of the relative pronouns are called relative clauses.
      - The relative pronouns are: `who`, `whom`, `whose`, `which`, `that`.
      - Relative pronouns connect an adjective clause to the word the clauses describes.
      - Examples
        - Ms. Harris, `whose son is an athelete`, is used to having their home filled with sporting equipment.
        - The person `of whom you spoke` is my cousin.

    - 4. NOUN Clause
