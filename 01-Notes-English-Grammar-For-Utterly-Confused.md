## English Grammar for the Utterly Confused (Laurie Rozakis)

## Chapter 1 - Part of Speech

### Adjectives

- Adjectives are words that describe nouns and pronouns.
- Adjective answers the questions:

  - What kind? - "red" nose, "gold" ring
  - How Much? - "more" sugar, "little" effort
  - Which One? - "second" chance, "those" chocolates
  - How Many? - "several" chances, "six" books

- There are five kinds of adjectives

  - Common Adjectives

    - Describes Nouns and pronouns
    - Example - "Strong" Man, "Green" Apple

  - Proper Adjective

    - Formed for Proper Nouns
    - Example - "Mexican" Food, "Indian" Curry

  - Compound Adjective

    - Made up of more than one word
    - Example - "far-off" country, "teenage" person

  - Articles

    - Articles are a special type of adjectives.
    - There are three articles: a, an, the
    - "the" is called "definite article" because it refers to specific thing
    - "a, an" are called "indefinite articles" because they refers to general things
    - Use "a" with constant sounds and "an" with vowel sound

  - Indefinite Adjective
    - Don't specify the specific amount of something
    - Example - all, another, any, both, each, either, few, many, more, most, neither, other, several, some

- RULE: Follow these guidelines when you use adjectives

  - Use an adjective to describe a noun or a pronoun
    - Example - Jesse(noun) was "willing" (adj) to leave "the"(adj) circus(noun)
  - Use vivid adjectives to make your writing more specific and descriptive
    - Example - Take a "larger"(adj) slice (noun) of the "luscious" (ajd) cake (noun)
  - Use an adjective after a linking verb. A linking verb connects a subject with a descriptive word.
    - The most common Linking Verbs are be(is, am, are, was, were, and so on), seem, appear, look, feel, smell, sound,
      taste, become, grow, remain, stay, and turn
    - Example - Chicken made this way "tastes" more "delicious"

- TIP:
  - Predicate Adjectives are adjectives separated from the noun and pronoun by a linking verb.
  - Predicate Adjectives describes the subject of the sentence
  - Example - The weather was cold all week

### Adverbs

- Adverbs are words that describes verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
- Adverbs answer the questions:
  - When? - left yesterday, begin now
  - Where? - fell below, move up
  - How? - happily sang, danced badly
  - To What extent? - partly finished, eat completely
- More Adverbs are formed by adding -ly to an adjective

  - Qucik - Quickly
  - Careful - Carefully
  - Accurate - Accurately

- RULE

  - Use an adverb to describe a verb

    - Example - Experiments using dynamite must be done(verb) "carefully (adv)"

  - Use an adverb to describe a adjective

    - Example - Sam had an "unbelievably(adv) huge(adj)" appetite for chips

  - Use an adverb to describe a adverb
    - Example - The sang "so(adv) clearly(adv)"

### Conjuctions

- Conjuctions connect the words or group of words

- There are three kind of conjunction:

  - Coordinate conjunction

    - link similar words or work groups
    - for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so (FANBOYS)

  - Correlative Conjuctions

    - link similar words and word groups
    - but they are always used in pairs
    - both...and, either...or, neither...nor, not only...but also, whether...or

  - Subordinating Conjuctions
    - link and independent clause (complete sentence) to a dependent clause (fragment).
    - after, although, as, as if
    - as long as, as soon as, as though, because
    - before, even though, if, in order that
    - since, so that, though, till
    - unless, until, when, whenever, where, wherever

### Interjections

- Interjections show strong emotions
- Since interjections are not linked gramatically to other words in the sentence, they are set off from the rest of
  the sentence with a comma or an exclamation mark.
- oh!, wow!

## Chapter 2 - Using Pronouns Correctly

- A Pronoun is a word used in a place of a noun or another noun.
- A Pronoun gets its meaning from the noun it replaces, called the "antecedent".
- Pronoun
  - Nominative Pronoun - The Pronoun is used as a subject.(I, You, He, She, It, We, They Who, Whoever)
  - Objective Pronoun - The Pronoun is used as a object. (Me, You, Him, Her, It, Us, Them, Whom, Whomever)
  - Possessive Pronoun - The Pronoun is used to show ownership. (My or Mine, Your or Yours, His, Her or Hers, Our or Ours, Their or Theirs, Whose, Whosever)

### Nominative Pronoun / Use the Nominative Case

- Use the Nominative Case to show the Subject of a Verb.
  - Ex1 - Father and "I" like to shop at flea Market
  - Ex2 - "I" like to shop at flea markets.
- Use the Nominative Case for a Predicative Nominative.
  - A Predicative Nominative is a Noun or Pronoun that follows a linking verb and identifies or renames the subject.
  - Remember that a Linking Verb connects a subject to a word that renames it. Linking Verbs indicate
    a state of being (am, is, are, etc.), relate to the senses (look, smell, taste, etc.), or indicate a condition (appear, seems, become, etc..)
  - Ex1 - The salesman of the month was "I". (Sometimes Objective nominative "Me" can also be used)

### Objective Pronoun / Use the Objective Case

- Use the Objective case to show a Direct Object
  - A Direct Object is a noun or pronoun that receives the action.
    - Ex1 - John's suit no longer fits "him".
    - Ex2 - "Whom" did she finally invite to the party.
- Use the Objective case to show an Indirect Object
  - An Indirect Object tells to or for whom something is done.
  - Ex1 - The bill gave "us" a shock
- Use the Objective case for the Object of a Preposition.
  - Ex1 - Sit by "me"

### Possessive Pronoun / Use the Possessive Case

- Use the Possessive case to show ownership.
  - Ex1 - The Child refused to believe that the sweater was "hers".
- Use the Possessive case before gerunds.
  - Ex1 - "Your" walking (gerund) in the rain didn't cause your cold.
- Use some possessive pronouns alone to show ownership.
  - Ex1 - The cell phone is "mine", not "yours"

## RULES - To Use correct Pronoun Reference

- 1. A Pronoun must clearly refer to a single antecendent. A common writing and speech problem occurs when the same
     pronoun refers to more than one antecendent. Remember a PRONOUN replaces a NOUN so always use the NOUN first
     before you use the pronouns.

     - Example (Incorrect Sentence)
       - Guilt and unkindness can be emotionally destructive to you and your friends. You must get rid of "them".
     - Example (Corrected Sentence)
       - Guilt and unkindness can be emotionally destructive to you and your friends. You must get rid of "these issues".
       - Guilt and unkindness can be emotionally destructive to you and your friends. You must get rid of "these destructive emotions"

- 2. Place Pronouns close to their antecendents.

     - Example (Incorrect Sentence)
       - After meeting with a few guests, the President entered the reception. At that point, Senator Chin and the other
         elected officials began to pose for Pictures. Even so, "he" did not join.
     - Example (Corrected Sentence)
       - After meeting with a few guests, the President entered the reception. At that point, Senator Chin and the other
         elected officials began to pose for Pictures. Even so, "the President" did not join.
       - After meeting with a few guests, the President entered the reception. He did not join Senator Chin and the other
         elected officials, even they have began to pose for Pictures.

3. Make a Pronoun refer to a definite antecedent. Be sure all pronouns refer to only one antecedent.
   - Example (Incorrect Sentence)
     - I told my friends that I was going to be a rockstar, which annoyed my mother.
   - Example (Corrected Sentence)
     - My mother was annoyed because I told my friends that I was going to be a rockstar.

### The Generic Masculine Pronoun

- Pronouns have Number, Person, and Gender.
- Example
  - A Student should turn in his assignments on time. (Masculine - Male)
  - A Student should turn in her assignments on time. (Feminini - Female)
  - Students should turn in their assignments on time. (Gender Neutral - Preferred one)

### Using WHO, WHICH, THAT

- WHO refers to people or animals
- THAT or WHICH refers to things, groups, and unnammed animals
  - The choise between WHICH and THAT depends of whether the clause introduced by the pronoun is RESTRICTIVE or NONRESTRICTIVE.
  - A Restrictive clause is essential to the sentence.
  - Use "That" for Restrictive and "Which" with nonrestrictive clauses.

### SUMMARY

- Case is the form of Noun or Pronoun that shows how it is used in a sentence.
- English has three cases: Nominative, Objective, and Possessive.
- Use the Nominative Case to show Subject of a verb.
- Use the Objective Case to show the Object of a verb.
- Use the Possessive Case to show Ownership.
- Make a Pronoun clearly refer to a single, definite antecedent.
- Place Pronouns close to their antecedents.

## Chapter 3 - Using Verbs Correctly

- Verbs are words that name an action or describe a state of being.
- There are four basic types - Action Verbs, Linking Verbs, Helping Verbs, and Verb Phrases.

- Regular Verbs

  - The past tense and past participle forms are created by adding -d, -ed, or -t to the Present form, but the vowel does not change.
  - Example
    - Walk, Walked, Walked

- Irregular Verbs

  - No pattern is followed when the past and past participle are formed.
  - Example
    - Begin, Began, Begun
    - Lose, Lost, Lost
    - Run, Run, Run
    - Lie, Lay, Lain
    - Lay, Laid, Laid

### Tenses

- PRESENT

  - Use Simple Present and Present Progressive to show events that take place now.

- PAST

  - Use SIX pasts forms to show the events that took place before the present.

  - 1. Simple Past

    - Completed Action (Indefinite Time) - We washed the car.
    - Completed Condition (Indefinite Time) - We were happy that the party was over.
    - Completed Action (Definite Time) - We washed the car yesterday.
    - Completed Condition (Definite Time) - I was delighted yesterday to receive the news.

  - 2. Present Perfect

    - Completed Action (Indefinite Time) - We have bought the gifts.
    - Completed Condition (Indefinite Time) - I have been very relieved.
    - Action Continuing into the Present - Sarah has called for two hours.
    - Condition Continuing into the Present - She has been in New York for a week.

  - 3. Past Perfect
    - Condition Completed before another - Greg had called all his friends before the party started.
    - Condition Completed - Greg had been a buther, before he became a guru.
  - 4. Past Progressive
    - Continuous Completed Action - I was attending a Spa that month.
  - 5. Present Perfect Progressive
    - Action Continuing into Present - Ralph has been exercising all week.
  - 6. Past Perfect Progressive
    - Continuing action interrupted by another - Katie had been reparing the fence that was damaged in the storm.

- FUTURE
  - Use the FOUR future forms to show events that take place in the future.
  - 1. Simple Future
    - Future Action - The bus will arrive.
    - Future Condition - I will be shocked when it does.
  - 2. Future Perfect
    - Future action completed before another - By the time you read this, the bus will have arrived.
    - Future condition completed before another - The storm will have been raging for an hour before the phone goes out.
  - 3. Future Progressive
    - Continuing future action - Janice will be exercising all summer.
  - 4. Future Perfect Progressive
    - Continuing future action completed before another - When we go on a vacation next week, I will have been exercising for a month.

### Active/Passive Voice

- Active Voice

  - A Verb is active when the subject performs the action.
  - Examples

    - I served a delicious meal.
    - We took the package home.

- Passive Voice

  - A Verb is passive when its action is performed upon the subject.
  - Examples
    - A package was taken home.
    - A delicious meal was served by me.

- RULES TO USE
  - In general, use the Active voice whenever possible because it is more direct and forceful.
  - Using the Active voice makes your writing more crisp and powerful.
  - The Active verb is one word rather than two.
  - Further, there is a no need for a prepositional phrase beginning with "by" if you use Active Voice.
  - USE of Passive Voice is preferable over the active voice under two conditions:
    - You don't want to assign blame.
      - Example - A mistake occurred with the filling system.
    - You don't know who did the action.
      - Example - A prank phone call was made at 02:00PM.

### SUMMARY

- A Verb's Tense shows when the action takes place. Use the right order of tenses to show the correct order of events.
- English verbs are divided into two classes: REGULAR and IRREGULAR.
- Voice shows the Subject acts (active voice) or is acted upon (passive voice).
  In general, use Active Voice instead of the Passive Voice.
