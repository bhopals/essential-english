## English Grammar for the Utterly Confused (Laurie Rozakis)

## Chapter 1 - Part of Speech

### Adjectives

- Adjectives are words that describe nouns and pronouns.
- Adjective answers the questions:

  - What kind? - "red" nose, "gold" ring
  - How Much? - "more" sugar, "little" effort
  - Which One? - "second" chance, "those" chocolates
  - How Many? - "several" chances, "six" books

- There are five kinds of adjectives

  - Common Adjectives

    - Describes Nouns and pronouns
    - Example - "Strong" Man, "Green" Apple

  - Proper Adjective

    - Formed for Proper Nouns
    - Example - "Mexican" Food, "Indian" Curry

  - Compound Adjective

    - Made up of more than one word
    - Example - "far-off" country, "teenage" person

  - Articles

    - Articles are a special type of adjectives.
    - There are three articles: a, an, the
    - "the" is called "definite article" because it refers to specific thing
    - "a, an" are called "indefinite articles" because they refers to general things
    - Use "a" with constant sounds and "an" with vowel sound

  - Indefinite Adjective
    - Don't specify the specific amount of something
    - Example - all, another, any, both, each, either, few, many, more, most, neither, other, several, some

- RULE: Follow these guidelines when you use adjectives

  - Use an adjective to describe a noun or a pronoun
    - Example - Jesse(noun) was "willing" (adj) to leave "the"(adj) circus(noun)
  - Use vivid adjectives to make your writing more specific and descriptive
    - Example - Take a "larger"(adj) slice (noun) of the "luscious" (ajd) cake (noun)
  - Use an adjective after a linking verb. A linking verb connects a subject with a descriptive word.
    - The most common Linking Verbs are be(is, am, are, was, were, and so on), seem, appear, look, feel, smell, sound,
      taste, become, grow, remain, stay, and turn
    - Example - Chicken made this way "tastes" more "delicious"

- TIP:
  - Predicate Adjectives are adjectives separated from the noun and pronoun by a linking verb.
  - Predicate Adjectives describes the subject of the sentence
  - Example - The weather was cold all week

### Adverbs

- Adverbs are words that describes verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.
- Adverbs answer the questions:
  - When? - left yesterday, begin now
  - Where? - fell below, move up
  - How? - happily sang, danced badly
  - To What extent? - partly finished, eat completely
- More Adverbs are formed by adding -ly to an adjective

  - Qucik - Quickly
  - Careful - Carefully
  - Accurate - Accurately

- RULE

  - Use an adverb to describe a verb

    - Example - Experiments using dynamite must be done(verb) "carefully (adv)"

  - Use an adverb to describe a adjective

    - Example - Sam had an "unbelievably(adv) huge(adj)" appetite for chips

  - Use an adverb to describe a adverb
    - Example - The sang "so(adv) clearly(adv)"

### Conjuctions

- Conjuctions connect the words or group of words

- There are three kind of conjunction:

  - Coordinate conjunction

    - link similar words or work groups
    - for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so (FANBOYS)

  - Correlative Conjuctions

    - link similar words and word groups
    - but they are always used in pairs
    - both...and, either...or, neither...nor, not only...but also, whether...or

  - Subordinating Conjuctions
    - link and independent clause (complete sentence) to a dependent clause (fragment).
    - after, although, as, as if
    - as long as, as soon as, as though, because
    - before, even though, if, in order that
    - since, so that, though, till
    - unless, until, when, whenever, where, wherever

### Interjections

- Interjections show strong emotions
- Since interjections are not linked gramatically to other words in the sentence, they are set off from the rest of
  the sentence with a comma or an exclamation mark.
- oh!, wow!

## Chapter 2 - Using Pronouns Correctly

- A Pronoun is a word used in a place of a noun or another noun.
- A Pronoun gets its meaning from the noun it replaces, called the "antecedent".
- Pronoun
  - Nominative Pronoun - The Pronoun is used as a subject.(I, You, He, She, It, We, They Who, Whoever)
  - Objective Pronoun - The Pronoun is used as a object. (Me, You, Him, Her, It, Us, Them, Whom, Whomever)
  - Possessive Pronoun - The Pronoun is used to show ownership. (My or Mine, Your or Yours, His, Her or Hers, Our or Ours, Their or Theirs, Whose, Whosever)

### Nominative Pronoun / Use the Nominative Case

- Use the Nominative Case to show the Subject of a Verb.
  - Ex1 - Father and "I" like to shop at flea Market
  - Ex2 - "I" like to shop at flea markets.
- Use the Nominative Case for a Predicative Nominative.
  - A Predicative Nominative is a Noun or Pronoun that follows a linking verb and identifies or renames the subject.
  - Remember that a Linking Verb connects a subject to a word that renames it. Linking Verbs indicate
    a state of being (am, is, are, etc.), relate to the senses (look, smell, taste, etc.), or indicate a condition (appear, seems, become, etc..)
  - Ex1 - The salesman of the month was "I". (Sometimes Objective nominative "Me" can also be used)

### Objective Pronoun / Use the Objective Case

- Use the Objective case to show a Direct Object
  - A Direct Object is a noun or pronoun that receives the action.
    - Ex1 - John's suit no longer fits "him".
    - Ex2 - "Whom" did she finally invite to the party.
- Use the Objective case to show an Indirect Object
  - An Indirect Object tells to or for whom something is done.
  - Ex1 - The bill gave "us" a shock
- Use the Objective case for the Object of a Preposition.
  - Ex1 - Sit by "me"

### Possessive Pronoun / Use the Possessive Case

- Use the Possessive case to show ownership.
  - Ex1 - The Child refused to believe that the sweater was "hers".
- Use the Possessive case before gerunds.
  - Ex1 - "Your" walking (gerund) in the rain didn't cause your cold.
- Use some possessive pronouns alone to show ownership.
  - Ex1 - The cell phone is "mine", not "yours"

## RULES - To Use correct Pronoun Reference

- 1. A Pronoun must clearly refer to a single antecendent. A common writing and speech problem occurs when the same
     pronoun refers to more than one antecendent. Remember a PRONOUN replaces a NOUN so always use the NOUN first
     before you use the pronouns.

     - Example (Incorrect Sentence)
       - Guilt and unkindness can be emotionally destructive to you and your friends. You must get rid of "them".
     - Example (Corrected Sentence)
       - Guilt and unkindness can be emotionally destructive to you and your friends. You must get rid of "these issues".
       - Guilt and unkindness can be emotionally destructive to you and your friends. You must get rid of "these destructive emotions"

- 2. Place Pronouns close to their antecendents.

     - Example (Incorrect Sentence)
       - After meeting with a few guests, the President entered the reception. At that point, Senator Chin and the other
         elected officials began to pose for Pictures. Even so, "he" did not join.
     - Example (Corrected Sentence)
       - After meeting with a few guests, the President entered the reception. At that point, Senator Chin and the other
         elected officials began to pose for Pictures. Even so, "the President" did not join.
       - After meeting with a few guests, the President entered the reception. He did not join Senator Chin and the other
         elected officials, even they have began to pose for Pictures.

3. Make a Pronoun refer to a definite antecedent. Be sure all pronouns refer to only one antecedent.
   - Example (Incorrect Sentence)
     - I told my friends that I was going to be a rockstar, which annoyed my mother.
   - Example (Corrected Sentence)
     - My mother was annoyed because I told my friends that I was going to be a rockstar.

### The Generic Masculine Pronoun

- Pronouns have Number, Person, and Gender.
- Example
  - A Student should turn in his assignments on time. (Masculine - Male)
  - A Student should turn in her assignments on time. (Feminini - Female)
  - Students should turn in their assignments on time. (Gender Neutral - Preferred one)

### Using WHO, WHICH, THAT

- WHO refers to people or animals
- THAT or WHICH refers to things, groups, and unnammed animals
  - The choise between WHICH and THAT depends of whether the clause introduced by the pronoun is RESTRICTIVE or NONRESTRICTIVE.
  - A Restrictive clause is essential to the sentence.
  - Use "That" for Restrictive and "Which" with nonrestrictive clauses.

### SUMMARY

- Case is the form of Noun or Pronoun that shows how it is used in a sentence.
- English has three cases: Nominative, Objective, and Possessive.
- Use the Nominative Case to show Subject of a verb.
- Use the Objective Case to show the Object of a verb.
- Use the Possessive Case to show Ownership.
- Make a Pronoun clearly refer to a single, definite antecedent.
- Place Pronouns close to their antecedents.
