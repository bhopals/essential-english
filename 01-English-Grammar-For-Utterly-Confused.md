### Adjectives

- Adjectives are words that describe nouns and pronouns.
- Adjective answers the questions:

  - What kind? - "red" nose, "gold" ring
  - How Much? - "more" sugar, "little" effort
  - Which One? - "second" chance, "those" chocolates
  - How Many? - "several" chances, "six" books

- There are five kinds of adjectives

  - Common Adjectives

    - Describes Nouns and pronouns

  - Compound Adjective

    - Made up of more than one word
    - Example - "far-off" country, "teenage" person

  - Articles

    - Articles are a special type of adjectives.
    - There are three articles: a, an, the
    - "the" is called "definite article" because it refers to specific thing
    - "a, an" are called "indefinite articles" because they refers to general things
    - Use "a" with constant sounds and "an" with vowel sound

  - Indefinite Adjective
    - Don't specify the specific amount of something
    - Example - all, another, any, both, each, either, few, many, more, most, neither, other, several, some

- RULE: Follow these guidelines when you use adjectives

  - Use an adjective to describe a noun or a pronoun
    - Example - Jesse(noun) was "willing" (adj) to leave "the"(adj) circus(noun)
  - Use vivid adjectives to make your writing more specific and descriptive
    - Example - Take a "larger"(adj) slice (noun) of the "luscious" (ajd) cake (noun)
  - Use an adjective after a linking verb. A linking verb connects a subject with a descriptive word.
    - The most common Linking Verbs are be(is, am, are, was, were, and so on), seem, appear, look, feel, smell, sound,
      taste, become, grow, remain, stay, and turn
    - Example - Chicken made this way "tastes" more "delicious"

- TIP:
  - Predicate Adjectives are adjectives separated from the noun and pronoun by a linking verb.

  - Example - The weather was cold all week
