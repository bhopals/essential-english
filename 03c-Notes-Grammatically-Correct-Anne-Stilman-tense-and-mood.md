# Grammatically Correct (Anne Stilman) - Tense and Mood

## INTRODUCTION

- A Tense is the form that a verb takes to indicate the time of its action.

- 1. Present, Past, Future
     - Each has following four varients - Simple, Progressive, Perfect, Perfect Progressive
     - A few other varients that have less broad application
       - PRESENT EMPHATIC, and PAST EMPHATIC
         - To accentuate(make more noticeable or prominent) statement in simple past, and simple present.
       - HABITUAL PAST
         - To describe something that used to occur on a regular basis.
       - FUTURE IN THE PAST
         - to express idea that at an earlier time point, there had been an expectation that something would later happen.

- 2. Every VERB can be formed in four ways
     - BASE Form - refular verb - first Form.
     - PAST Form - adding `ed`, `d`, `t` in the end of the base form.
     - PRESENT Participle - formed by adding `ing` to the base form.
     - PAST Participle - past form of regular verb

- 3. The nature of a verb restricts whice tenses it can take on. One of the ways in which verbs can be categorized is

  - DYNAMIC Verbs
    - Also called NORMAL, involve actions or processes. for example, jump, write, whisper, cough, melt, memorize
    - These actions or processes do not have to be observable,
      but they all involve something happening or being done, with a START and a FINISH
  - STATIC Verbs
    - Also called NON-CONTINUOUS, involve perceptions, emotions, or that relationship between things
      for example, want, like, believe, need, prefer, contain, resemble
  - Few Verbs can be used as DYNAMIC as well as STATIC

- 4. In addition to the main verb, almost all tenses inclide auxiliary verbs
     - Common auxiliary verbs are `have`, `be`, `will`, `can`, and `would`

- 5. Verb usage in Active and Passive voice
- 6. The mood of a verb deals with the concept of whether a statement is
     - expressing a fact (indicative mood)
     - a possibility or liklihood (condition mood)
     - a command or instruction (imperative mood)

## RULE DETAILS

### - PRESENT TENSE

### SIMPLE PRESENT

- Formed by using just the base form of the action verb, with `s` added for the third person singular (`he`, `she`, or `it`).

- 1. Use it to describe a habitual action, circumstance, or state of affairs; a trait, a routine, a custom.

  - Examples
    - I `go` for an ear candling therapy session every Wednesday.
    - My aunt `plays` the kettle drums.
    - He `knows` his way around the pool hall too well.
    - The queen `likes` corgis.
    - What do you think about this sculpture? I `hate` it.
    - Which flavor ice cream `does` your son want? He `wants` banana bubblegum chocolate chip, please.

- 2. Use it in statements referring to the future that include any expression having to do with time (When, once, if unless, after, etc.)
     even though the event has not yet happened.

  - Examples
    - I will pay you as he `pays` me (NOT: as soon as he will pay me).
    - When the timer `goes` off, please turn the head down under the haggis (NOT: when the timer will go off)

- 3. In dialogue (not in formal writing), optionally use it with dynamic verbs to describe something scheduled to happen in the near future.

     - Examples

       - My flight `leaves` in two hours - gotta go.
       - I `see` my hairdresser next Thursday, so I will get the dirt then.

     - Saying `my flight will leave` (simple future), while accurate, would sound a bit stilted; the simple present is more natural in speech.

- 4. In dialogue, optionally use it to indicate something that happened in the recent past.

     - Example

       - Your mother `tells` me you are engaged. [The telling is not happenin at this very moment]
       - I `hear` that he is thinking of writing the Great American Novel. [Hearing is not happening at this very moment]

     - This is slightly more casual than using the simple past(`your mother told me...` or `I heard...`)

- 5. Negative formation

  - Examples
    - I like `popcorns` / I `do not` like `popcorns`.
    - She `takes` an hour to get ready / She `does not take` an hour to get ready.

- 6. Passive formation
  - Examples
    - His magnificence `overwhelms` her / She `is` `overwhelmed` by his magnifience.
    - My parents always `give` me socks for my birthday / I `am` always `given` socks for my birthday.

### PRESENT PROGRESSIVE

- Also called the present continuous.
- Formed by combining SIMPLE PRESENT of the auxiliary verb be (am, are, you etc) with the present participle of the action verb.
- This tense can only be used with DYNAMIC Verbs (verb + ing)

- 1. Use it to refer to an action or event that is occuring right now and has not yet finished.

  - Examples
    - Sorry she can't come to the phone right now - she is playing her kettle drum.
    - He `is` `finishing` his coffee - he will be with you in a sec.
    - Have you decided yet what you will order? No I `am` still `thinking`.
  - NOTE - This tense does not work with stative verbs (hate, want)
    - What do you think of this sculpture? I am `hating` it (INCORRECT)
    - What flavor ice cream does your son want? He is `wanting` the banana bubblegum chocolate chip, please (INCORRECT)

- 2. Like the simple present, present progressive can be used to refer to a future scheduled event.

     - Examples

       - He is starting universities in a fall.
       - Their train is leaving in an hour.
       - It is not on my calendar, but I am positive we are having tea with duchess next Saturday.

     - Both of below examples describe the same circumstance (Seeing a fried that will happen in the evening):
       - Present Progressive: I can't, I am seeing another friend that evening.
         - This indicates that the competing activity was already in place before the invitation.
       - Simple Future: I can't, I will see another friend that evening.
         - This indicates a suggestion that plans will be hastly made in order to have a reason to decline.

- 3.  Passive Formation
  - Use the present progressive of be (am being, are being, is being) followed by the past participle of the action verb.
  - Examples
    - I think she is manipulating him / I think he is being manipulated by her.
    - The nurse is totally ignoring us / We are being ignored by the nurse.

### PRESENT PERFECT

- Formed by combining the sipmle present of the auxiliary verb have (has, have) with the past participle of the action verb.
- Confusingly, this tense refers to something that has already happened.
- The Present Perfect Captures the idea that there is some `current relevance` to the past action.
  and that as of this time, one has had experience of doing something.

- 1. Use the present perfect to descrive something that has only just completed and has immediate relevance for the present.
     - Examples
       - OK, I `have finished` building the Great Pyramid.
       - Is Iris still there? No she `has gone` home.

  OR to describe events at any time in the past, provided there is a current relevance.

  - Examples
    - She `has raised` six kids, so she should know what is she talking about.
    - We `have blown` too many chances; we have got to get it right this time.

- 2. Use it with the time indicators `since` or `for` to refer to an event or state of affairs that started earlier and
     is still in effect at the present time. This tense works with both Dynamic and Static verbs.

     - Example

       - He has lived in a tree house for the last two years.
       - She has raised cattle since 2007
       - I have known him since kindergarten.
       - He has owned that car for twelve years.

     - NOTE - DO NOT USE it to refer to an event that took place at a specified time in the past.

       - INCORRECT - He has written six letters to the editor this week.
       - CORRECT - He wrote six letters to the editor this week.

       - INCORRECT - They have gone to their country house on Sunday.
       - CORRECT - They went to their country house on Sunday.

- 3. Passive formation
  - Use the Present Perfect of be (have been, has been) followed by the past participle of the action verb.
  - Examples
    - They have given him a huge grant to study the preservation of the broom crowberry. (Active)
    - He has been given a huge grant to study the preservation of the broom crowberry. (Passive)
    - I trusted them, but I think they have takes me for a ride. (Active)
    - I trusted them, but I think I have been taken for a ride. (Passive)
    - He has worked with lab rats for years, but he has never been bitten. (Passive)
    - Our team's only been beaten once in the last eight games. (Passive)
    - There are no injuries, but she has been shook up a bit. (Passive)

### PRESENT PERFECT CONTINUOUS

- Also called the present perfect continuous. Formed by combining the simple present of the auxiliary verb `have` (I `have`, he `has`)
- The auxiliary verb `been`, and the present participle of the action verb.
- This tense works only with dynamic verbs.
- It is used to indicate that an action or event that started earlier is still happening or still holds true.

- 1. Use it to indicate ongoing action

  - While the present perfect can also be used for this purpose, it requires a time indicator such as `since` or `for`. In contrast,
    the present perfect progressive always means that the action is still ongoing, whether or not the time indicator is included.
  - Examples

    - You are right. I `have been watching` this pot, and it has not boiled yet.
    - You `have been spying` on me, haven't you?
    - My husband `has been following` the extreme ironing competition all week.

  - The distinction between the present perfect and the present perfect progressive can be subtle.

    - Always use PRESENT PERFECT when the action referred to has ended.
    - Always PRESENT PERFECT PROGRESSIVE when the action is still ongoing
      - (except for sentences with time indicators - where you have a choice of which tense to use.)
    - Examples
      - I `have racked` my brains to try to come up with a good example [I am giving up]
      - I `have been racking` my brains to try to come up with a good example [I am still working on it]
      - You `have done` only one chore in all this time? [at least you got one completed]
      - You `have been doing` only one chore in all this time? [and you are still at it?]

  - Consistent with this distinction of COMPLETED versus ONGOING, use the PRESENT PERFECT when referring to the
    `number of times` something has occured, and PRESENT PERFECT PROGRESSIVE when referring to `a period of time`.
    - Examples
      - I `have tried` his number ten times, but no answer. [not: I have been trying this number ten times]
      - I `have been trying` his number for the last hour, but no answer. [not: I have tried his number for the last hour]
      - She `has written` six books about her grievances already [not: she has been writing six books]
      - She `has been writting` about her grievances for years. [not: she has written for years]

- 2. Use it with the time indicators `since` or `for` to convey essentiallly the same meaning as the Present Perfect.

  - Examples
    - He `has been living` in a tree house for the last two years [same meaning as `he has lived`]
    - She `has been raising` iguana since 2007 [sme meaning as `she has raised`]
  - In this situation, the PRESENT PERFECT PROGRESSIVE arguably puts slightly more emphasis on the PRESENT.
  - However, the PRESENT PERFECT slightly more emphasis on the PAST.
  - The distinction is trifling, however, and either tense could be used in these sentences with no essential difference in meaning.
  - NOTE:

    - This tense does not work with the STATITIVE VERBS, either with or without time indicators.
    - The following examples are INCORRECT
      - I `have been knowing` him since kindergarten. [correct - I `have known` him since kindergarten]
      - He `has been owning` that car for twelve years [correct - He `has owned` that car for twelve years]

  - Stative verbs often relate to:

    - `thoughts and opinions`: agree, believe, doubt, guess, imagine, know, mean, recognise, remember, suspect, think, understand
    - `feelings and emotions`: dislike, hate, like, love, prefer, want, wish
    - `senses and perceptions`: appear, be, feel, hear, look, see, seem, smell, taste
    - `possession and measurement`: belong, have, measure, own, possess, weigh.

  - Some of those stative verbs can be used as Dynamic verbs as well.

- 3. Passive Formation
  - The passive voice does not lend itself well to any of the prefect progressive tenses, and usually BETTER AVOIDED.
  - It takes the Present Perfect Continuous of BE (have been being or has been being) followed bt the past participle
    of theaction verb. The result does not exactly trip off the tongue.
  - Examples
    - They `have been renovating` their house for months / Their house `has been being renovated` for months.
    - She `has been stringing` him along for too long / He `has been being strung` along by her for too long.
