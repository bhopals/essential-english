# Grammatically Correct (Anne Stilman) - Tense and Mood

## INTRODUCTION

- A Tense is the form that a verb takes to indicate the time of its action.

- 1. Present, Past, Future
     - Each has following four varients - Simple, Progressive, Perfect, Perfect Progressive
     - A few other varients that have less broad application
       - PRESENT EMPHATIC, and PAST EMPHATIC
         - To accentuate(make more noticeable or prominent) statement in simple past, and simple present.
       - HABITUAL PAST
         - To describe something that used to occur on a regular basis.
       - FUTURE IN THE PAST
         - to express idea that at an earlier time point, there had been an expectation that something would later happen.

- 2. Every VERB can be formed in four ways
     - BASE Form - refular verb - first Form.
     - PAST Form - adding `ed`, `d`, `t` in the end of the base form.
     - PRESENT Participle - formed by adding `ing` to the base form.
     - PAST Participle - past form of regular verb

- 3. The nature of a verb restricts whice tenses it can take on. One of the ways in which verbs can be categorized is

  - DYNAMIC Verbs
    - Also called NORMAL, involve actions or processes. for example, jump, write, whisper, cough, melt, memorize
    - These actions or processes do not have to be observable,
      but they all involve something happening or being done, with a START and a FINISH
  - STATIC Verbs
    - Also called NON-CONTINUOUS, involve perceptions, emotions, or that relationship between things
      for example, want, like, believe, need, prefer, contain, resemble
  - Few Verbs can be used as DYNAMIC as well as STATIC

- 4. In addition to the main verb, almost all tenses inclide auxiliary verbs
     - Common auxiliary verbs are `have`, `be`, `will`, `can`, and `would`

- 5. Verb usage in Active and Passive voice
- 6. The mood of a verb deals with the concept of whether a statement is
     - expressing a fact (indicative mood)
     - a possibility or liklihood (condition mood)
     - a command or instruction (imperative mood)

## RULE DETAILS

### - PRESENT TENSE

### SIMPLE PRESENT

- Formed by using just the base form of the action verb, with `s` added for the third person singular (`he`, `she`, or `it`).

- 1. Use it to describe a habitual action, circumstance, or state of affairs; a trait, a routine, a custom.

  - Examples
    - I `go` for an ear candling therapy session every Wednesday.
    - My aunt `plays` the kettle drums.
    - He `knows` his way around the pool hall too well.
    - The queen `likes` corgis.
    - What do you think about this sculpture? I `hate` it.
    - Which flavor ice cream `does` your son want? He `wants` banana bubblegum chocolate chip, please.

- 2. Use it in statements referring to the future that include any expression having to do with time (When, once, if unless, after, etc.)
     even though the event has not yet happened.

  - Examples
    - I will pay you as he `pays` me (NOT: as soon as he will pay me).
    - When the timer `goes` off, please turn the head down under the haggis (NOT: when the timer will go off)

- 3. In dialogue (not in formal writing), optionally use it with dynamic verbs to describe something scheduled to happen in the near future.

     - Examples

       - My flight `leaves` in two hours - gotta go.
       - I `see` my hairdresser next Thursday, so I will get the dirt then.

     - Saying `my flight will leave` (simple future), while accurate, would sound a bit stilted; the simple present is more natural in speech.

- 4. In dialogue, optionally use it to indicate something that happened in the recent past.

     - Example

       - Your mother `tells` me you are engaged. [The telling is not happenin at this very moment]
       - I `hear` that he is thinking of writing the Great American Novel. [Hearing is not happening at this very moment]

     - This is slightly more casual than using the simple past(`your mother told me...` or `I heard...`)

- 5. Negative formation

  - Examples
    - I like `popcorns` / I `do not` like `popcorns`.
    - She `takes` an hour to get ready / She `does not take` an hour to get ready.

- 6. Passive formation
  - Examples
    - His magnificence `overwhelms` her / She `is` `overwhelmed` by his magnifience.
    - My parents always `give` me socks for my birthday / I `am` always `given` socks for my birthday.

### PRESENT PROGRESSIVE

- Also called the present continuous.
- Formed by combining SIMPLE PRESENT of the auxiliary verb be (am, are, you etc) with the present participle of the action verb.
- This tense can only be used with DYNAMIC Verbs (verb + ing)

- 1. Use it to refer to an action or event that is occuring right now and has not yet finished.

  - Examples
    - Sorry she can't come to the phone right now - she is playing her kettle drum.
    - He `is` `finishing` his coffee - he will be with you in a sec.
    - Have you decided yet what you will order? No I `am` still `thinking`.
  - NOTE - This tense does not work with stative verbs (hate, want)
    - What do you think of this sculpture? I am `hating` it (INCORRECT)
    - What flavor ice cream does your son want? He is `wanting` the banana bubblegum chocolate chip, please (INCORRECT)

- 2. Like the simple present, present progressive can be used to refer to a future scheduled event.

     - Examples

       - He is starting universities in a fall.
       - Their train is leaving in an hour.
       - It is not on my calendar, but I am positive we are having tea with duchess next Saturday.

     - Both of below examples describe the same circumstance (Seeing a fried that will happen in the evening):
       - Present Progressive: I can't, I am seeing another friend that evening.
         - This indicates that the competing activity was already in place before the invitation.
       - Simple Future: I can't, I will see another friend that evening.
         - This indicates a suggestion that plans will be hastly made in order to have a reason to decline.

- 3.  Passive Formation
  - Use the present progressive of be (am being, are being, is being) followed by the past participle of the action verb.
  - Examples
    - I think she is manipulating him / I think he is being manipulated by her.
    - The nurse is totally ignoring us / We are being ignored by the nurse.

### PRESENT PERFECT

- Formed by combining the sipmle present of the auxiliary verb have (has, have) with the past participle of the action verb.
- Confusingly, this tense refers to something that has already happened.
- The Present Perfect Captures the idea that there is some `current relevance` to the past action.
  and that as of this time, one has had experience of doing something.

- 1. Use the present perfect to descrive something that has only just completed and has immediate relevance for the present.
     - Examples
       - OK, I `have finished` building the Great Pyramid.
       - Is Iris still there? No she `has gone` home.

  OR to describe events at any time in the past, provided there is a current relevance.

  - Examples
    - She `has raised` six kids, so she should know what is she talking about.
    - We `have blown` too many chances; we have got to get it right this time.

- 2. Use it with the time indicators `since` or `for` to refer to an event or state of affairs that started earlier and
     is still in effect at the present time. This tense works with both Dynamic and Static verbs.

     - Example

       - He has lived in a tree house for the last two years.
       - She has raised cattle since 2007
       - I have known him since kindergarten.
       - He has owned that car for twelve years.

     - NOTE - DO NOT USE it to refer to an event that took place at a specified time in the past.

       - INCORRECT - He has written six letters to the editor this week.
       - CORRECT - He wrote six letters to the editor this week.

       - INCORRECT - They have gone to their country house on Sunday.
       - CORRECT - They went to their country house on Sunday.

- 3. Passive formation
  - Use the Present Perfect of be (have been, has been) followed by the past participle of the action verb.
  - Examples
    - They have given him a huge grant to study the preservation of the broom crowberry. (Active)
    - He has been given a huge grant to study the preservation of the broom crowberry. (Passive)
    - I trusted them, but I think they have takes me for a ride. (Active)
    - I trusted them, but I think I have been taken for a ride. (Passive)
    - He has worked with lab rats for years, but he has never been bitten. (Passive)
    - Our team's only been beaten once in the last eight games. (Passive)
    - There are no injuries, but she has been shook up a bit. (Passive)

### PRESENT PERFECT CONTINUOUS

- Also called the present perfect continuous. Formed by combining the simple present of the auxiliary verb `have` (I `have`, he `has`)
- The auxiliary verb `been`, and the present participle of the action verb.
- This tense works only with dynamic verbs.
- It is used to indicate that an action or event that started earlier is still happening or still holds true.

- 1. Use it to indicate ongoing action

  - While the present perfect can also be used for this purpose, it requires a time indicator such as `since` or `for`. In contrast,
    the present perfect progressive always means that the action is still ongoing, whether or not the time indicator is included.
  - Examples

    - You are right. I `have been watching` this pot, and it has not boiled yet.
    - You `have been spying` on me, haven't you?
    - My husband `has been following` the extreme ironing competition all week.

  - The distinction between the present perfect and the present perfect progressive can be subtle.

    - Always use PRESENT PERFECT when the action referred to has ended.
    - Always PRESENT PERFECT PROGRESSIVE when the action is still ongoing
      - (except for sentences with time indicators - where you have a choice of which tense to use.)
    - Examples
      - I `have racked` my brains to try to come up with a good example [I am giving up]
      - I `have been racking` my brains to try to come up with a good example [I am still working on it]
      - You `have done` only one chore in all this time? [at least you got one completed]
      - You `have been doing` only one chore in all this time? [and you are still at it?]

  - Consistent with this distinction of COMPLETED versus ONGOING, use the PRESENT PERFECT when referring to the
    `number of times` something has occured, and PRESENT PERFECT PROGRESSIVE when referring to `a period of time`.
    - Examples
      - I `have tried` his number ten times, but no answer. [not: I have been trying this number ten times]
      - I `have been trying` his number for the last hour, but no answer. [not: I have tried his number for the last hour]
      - She `has written` six books about her grievances already [not: she has been writing six books]
      - She `has been writting` about her grievances for years. [not: she has written for years]

- 2. Use it with the time indicators `since` or `for` to convey essentiallly the same meaning as the Present Perfect.

  - Examples
    - He `has been living` in a tree house for the last two years [same meaning as `he has lived`]
    - She `has been raising` iguana since 2007 [sme meaning as `she has raised`]
  - In this situation, the PRESENT PERFECT PROGRESSIVE arguably puts slightly more emphasis on the PRESENT.
  - However, the PRESENT PERFECT slightly more emphasis on the PAST.
  - The distinction is trifling, however, and either tense could be used in these sentences with no essential difference in meaning.
  - NOTE:

    - This tense does not work with the STATITIVE VERBS, either with or without time indicators.
    - The following examples are INCORRECT
      - I `have been knowing` him since kindergarten. [correct - I `have known` him since kindergarten]
      - He `has been owning` that car for twelve years [correct - He `has owned` that car for twelve years]

  - Stative verbs often relate to:

    - `thoughts and opinions`: agree, believe, doubt, guess, imagine, know, mean, recognise, remember, suspect, think, understand
    - `feelings and emotions`: dislike, hate, like, love, prefer, want, wish
    - `senses and perceptions`: appear, be, feel, hear, look, see, seem, smell, taste
    - `possession and measurement`: belong, have, measure, own, possess, weigh.

  - Some of those stative verbs can be used as Dynamic verbs as well.

- 3. Passive Formation
  - The passive voice does not lend itself well to any of the prefect progressive tenses, and usually BETTER AVOIDED.
  - It takes the Present Perfect Continuous of BE (have been being or has been being) followed bt the past participle
    of theaction verb. The result does not exactly trip off the tongue.
  - Examples
    - They `have been renovating` their house for months / Their house `has been being renovated` for months.
    - She `has been stringing` him along for too long / He `has been being strung` along by her for too long.

### PRESENT EMPHATIC

- Formed by combining the simple present of the auxiliary verb `do` (`I/you/we/they do`, `he/she/it does`) with the base form of ACTION VERB.
- This tense indicates the same time of action as the simple present but, as the name makes obvious, underscores a point more STRONGLY.
- However, it is not used frequently.

- Use it when the intention is to stress a point; typically when either contradicting a perceding statement.
  - Examples
    - Why did you bother buying that exercise bike, when you never use it? I `do use` it.
    - I am afraid she does not like me. Nonsense, `she does like` you. [more emphatic than `she likes`]
- or STRONGLY AGREEING with it.
  - Examples
    - I like her voice. Yes, `she does sing` beautifully. [more emphatic than Yes, `she sings` beautifully]
    - I think these paid pants and paisley shirt are a good combination, don't you? Yes, `they do go` well together
      [more emphatic than Yes, `they go` well together]

### PAST TENSE

### SIMPLE PAST

- Formed by using just the past form of the action verb.
- No surprises here: it always refers to an event that tool place prior to the present time.
- The SIMPLE PAST is of course the standard tense used in narrative, in both fiction writing and non-fiction writing.
- 1. Use it when referring to a past event, whether the time is specified.

  - Example
    - I `graduated` ten years ago.
    - She `left` the company a year ago.
      OR not (no reference of the time)
  - Example
    - I `graduated` with honors.
    - She `left` her executive position to become a personal shopper.

- 2. Negative Formation

  - For a negative statement, add the past form of `do` (`did`) + `not`, and put the action verb in the base form
    rather that the past tense form.
    - Examples
      - She `saw` him / She `didn't see` him.
      - The `handled` that well / They `didn't handle` that well.

- 3. Passive Formation
  - Use the past form of be (was or were) followed by the past participle of the action verb.
  - Examples
    - The `downed` their food in about two minutes / Their food `was downed` in about two minutes.
    - The mosquitoes `dive-bombed` us / We `were dive-bombed` by mosquitos.

### Past Progressive

- Also called the Past Continuous.
- Formed by combining the PAST FORM of the auxiliary verb `be` (I `was`, I `were`) with the present particple of the action verb.
- It can be used only with DYNAMIC Verbs.
- 1. Use it to convey the idea of one activity or state of affairs being in progress when another event happened.

  - Examples
    - She `was minding` her own business when this blackbird came along and pecked off her nose.
    - The tub `was overflowing` by the time he figured out how to turn the tap off.

- 2. Use it to describe ongoing activities that were taking place in parallel.

  - Examples

    - Mr. Philip `was` back in the corner `explaining` a problem in algebra to Andrew, and the rest
      of the scholars `were doing` pretty much as they pleased, `eating` green apples, `whispering` drawing pictures on
      their slate, and `driving` crickets

  - Note: Do not use the past Progressive to refer to an event that took place at a specified time in the past.
    - Examples
      - I `was graduating` ten years ago.(Incorrect) / I `graduated`. (Correct)
      - She `was leaving` an hour ago. (Incorrect)/ She `left`. (Correct)
      - We `were going` to Helsinki last year. (Incorrect) / We `went` (Correct)

- 3. Passive Form

  - Use the past progressive of `be` (`was being`, `were being`) followed by the past participle of the action verb.
  - Examples
    - She `was treating` him rudely / He `was being treated` rudely.
    - Ten men `were pulling` on the ropes / The ropes `were being pulled` on by ten men.

### Past Perfect

- Formed by combining the past form of the auxiliary verb have (`had` in all cases, frequently contracted to `'d`)
  with the past participle of the action verb.
- Use this tense to indicate that an action or event in the past happened earlier than some other action
  or event in the past, or that it happened earlier than some specified time in the past.

- 1. When referring to two or more past actions or events, use the past perfect to indicate that event A was completed
     before event B occured.

  - Examples

    - It was only when the hostess introduced them that she remembered she had met him once before
      [`met` happened prior to `introduced` or `remembered`]
    - The road suddenly ended at the top of a cliff, at which point we realized we had missed the turn-off.
      [`missed` happened prior to `ended` or `realized`]

    - With stative verbs, use it to indicate that `action A` was in effect at the point at which `action B` occured.
    - Examples
      - I `had known` that she was rich, but I `was still taken` by surprise when she perensted me with a yatch for my birthday.
      - He `had liked` her a lot until `he found` out about the bodies buried in her cellar.
    - With dynamic verbs, use the past perfect progressive for this purpose instead.

- 2. When a sentence refers to a single action or event, this tense indicates that the action or event took place
     was in effect at some time prior to the time under discussion.
     - Examples
       - We `had heard` all his stories a million times already.
       - I `had never` seen such a mess.
       - We `were told` that the cup `had belonged` to the Borgia family.

- 3. Passive Formation

     - Use the past perfect of `be` (`had been`) followed by the past participle of the action verbs.
     - Examples

       - We `had given` him enough chances (Active Voice)
       - He `had been given` enough chances (Passive Voice)

       - He `had driven` her to appointment countless times (Active Voice)
       - She `had been driven` to appointment by him countless times. (Passive Voice)

### Past Perfect Continuous

- Also called the past perfect continuous. Formed by combining the `past form` of the auxiliary verb `have` (`had` in
  all cases, frequently contracted to `'d`), the auxiliary verb `been`, and the `present participle` of the action verb.
- This Tense can only be used with dynamic verbs.
- 1. Use it to indicate that some action or event A that began in the past was still ongoing when some later action or event B occured.

  - Examples

    - We `had been stirring` the potion for just a few minutes when it `began` to spew green smoke.
      [the stirring was still in progress when the spewing began]
    - He `had been waiting` on tables for years before he finally `got` his big break.
      [the server job was still in progress at the point that the studio came calling]

  - This tense doesn not work with stative verbs. The following examples are incorrect.
    - Examples
      - I `had been knowing` that she was rich but... (should be `had known`)
      - He `had been liking` her a lot until... (should be `had liked`)
    - Use the Past Perfect instead in case of Dynamic Verbs

- 2. Use it to indicate that a single action or event took place over some period of time.

  - Examples
    - I could not report on what `had been said` at the teleconference because I `had been playing` online solitaire the whole time.
    - They `had been living` in a commune before they `started` their family.

- 3. Passive Formation

  - As with the present perfect continuous, the passive voice becomes very clumsy in this tense and is not recommended.
  - It consists of the `past perfect progressive` of `be` (`had been being`) followed by the `past participle` of the action verb.
  - Examples

    - Women `had been chasing` him for years (Active Voice)
    - He `had been being chased` by women for years. (Passive Voice)

    - Beavers `had apparently been chomping` on the tree trunks (Active Voice)
    - The tree trunks `had apparently been being chomped` on by beavers. (Passive Voice)
