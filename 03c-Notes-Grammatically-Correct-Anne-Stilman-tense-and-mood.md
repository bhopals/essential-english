## Tense and Mood

- A Tense is the form that a verb takes to indicate the time of its action.

- 1. Present, Past, Future
     - Each has following four varients - Simple, Progressive, Perfect, Perfect Progressive
     - A few other varients that have less broad application
       - PRESENT EMPHATIC, and PAST EMPHATIC
         - To accentuate(make more noticeable or prominent) statement in simple past, and simple present.
       - HABITUAL PAST
         - To describe something that used to occur on a regular basis.
       - FUTURE IN THE PAST
         - to express idea that at an earlier time point, there had been an expectation that something would later happen.

- 2. Every VERB can be formed in four ways
     - BASE Form - refular verb - first Form.
     - PAST Form - adding `ed`, `d`, `t` in the end of the base form.
     - PRESENT Participle - formed by adding `ing` to the base form.
     - PAST Participle - past form of regular verb

- 3. The nature of a verb restricts whice tenses it can take on. One of the ways in which verbs can be categorized is

  - DYNAMIC Verbs
    - Also called NORMAL, involve actions or processes. for example, jump, write, whisper, cough, melt, memorize
    - These actions or processes do not have to be observable,
      but they all involve something happening or being done, with a START and a FINISH
  - STATIC Verbs
    - Also called NON-CONTINUOUS, involve perceptions, emotions, or that relationship between things
      for example, want, like, believe, need, prefer, contain, resemble
  - Few Verbs can be used as DYNAMIC as well as STATIC

- 4. In addition to the main verb, almost all tenses inclide auxiliary verbs
     - Common auxiliary verbs are `have`, `be`, `will`, `can`, and `would`

- 5. Verb usage in Active and Passive voice
- 6. The mood of a verb deals with the concept of whether a statement is
     - expressing a fact (indicative mood)
     - a possibility or liklihood (condition mood)
     - a command or instruction (imperative mood)
