# Grammatically Correct (Anne Stilman)

## Positioning of Modifiers

- A Modifier is an element of a sentence that describes or qualifies some other element.
- Adjectives, and adverbs are the most common modifiers, but a phrase or dependent clause can act as one too.
- All elements in a sentence must be positioned so that any modifier is acting upon what it is supposed to.
  Failure to do so may lead to some disconcerning results. There are THREE types of problems to look out for:

  - DANGLING MODIFIERS
  - MISPLACED MODIFIERS
  - SQUINTING MODIFIERS

### Dangling Modifiers

If a sentence is carelessly constructed so that entity to be modified is implied rather than explicitly stated, the modifier
is left `dangling` - left at loose ends as it were - and in the absense of the intended `modify-ee`, ends up latching onto
whatever happens to come next, resulting in a nonsense sentence, For example:

- INCORRECT - `Just two years after finishing graduate school, Adelaide career took off.`

Presumably, it was Adelaide who finished grad school, but she makes no direct appearance in the sentence; ONLY HER CAREER DOES.
Gramattically, what is being said here is that Aldelaide's career finished grad school and then took off :D
The above Problem can be REMEDIED by rewording either the PHRASE or the CLAUSE.

- CORRECT - `Just two years after Aldelaide finished graduate school, her career took off.`
- CORRECT - `Just two years after finishing graduate school, Aldelaide saw her career took off.`

The absurdities that result from dangling modifiers can range from the obvious to the subtle.
Fortunately, even when syntax is garbled, readers are usually able to process a sentence in the way the writers intended it.

- EXERCISE

  - 1. Upon opening the pantry door, a stack of cans flew out at her.
       Problem: How did the stack of cans manage to open the pantry door?
       Solution: When she opened the pantry door, a stack of cans flew out at her.

  - 2. Unlike dashes, a writer may use parentheses to enclose an entire sentence, not just part of a sentence.
       Problem: Lol.. this seems unfair; If writers may use parentheses this way, why shouldn't dashes be permitted to do so as well?
       Solution: Unlike dashes, parentheses may be used to enclose an entire sentence, not just part of a sentence.

  - 3. Awaiting the starter's gun, Pierre's heart began to thumb rapidally.
       Problem: Pierre's heart must have good ears :D
       Solution: Awaiting the starter's gun, Pierre's felt his heart began to thumb rapidally.

  - 4. After ransacking the house, Ben's wallet finally turned up under the dog's water bowl.
       Problem: That one is active Wallet?
       Solution: After ransacking the house, Ben finally found his wallet under the dog's water bowl.

  - 5. Thumbing through the newspaper, my eye was suddenly caught by a smaller item.
       Problem: Unusual Ocular anatomy :D
       Solution: As I Thumbed through the newspaper, my eye was suddenly caught by a smaller item.

### Misplaced Modifiers

Like a Dangling modifier , a misplaced modifier acts on something other than what the writer intended.
In this case, the problem is not that the `intended subject` isn't clearly identified in the sentence but
that the modifier is in the wrong position relative to what it should be affecting.
(Whenver possible, the two elements should lie right next to each other) For example:

- INCORRECT - `We put out an appeal for more volunteers to help with the fall program at last week's meeting.`

Presumbly, what happended at last week's meeting was an appeal for help with the fall program, but the positioning of
the modifier makes it sound as if the fall program itself was held at last week's meeting. The Problem can be remedied
by moving the modifying phrase.

- CORRECT - `At last week's meeting, we put out an appeal for more volunteers to help with the fall program.`

- EXERCISE

  - 6. Leaning over the hospital bed, she looked into the vacant man's eyes but could see no spark of recognition.
       Problem: The man himself is vacant?
       Solution: Leaning over the hospital bed, she looked into the man's vacant eyes but could see no spark of recognition.

  - 7. At its next meeting, the Board of Education will debate whether teachers to be allowed to administer adrenaline to students who
       experience severe allergic reactions without written permission.
       Problem: One has to admire the discipline of those students who do first obtain permission.
       Solution: At its next meeting, the Board of Education will debate whether teachers should require written
       premission to administer adrenaline to students who experience severe allergic reactions.

  - 8. The formerly galmorous countess is now continually mocked in the tabloids for her taste in clothing, weight, and overspending.
       Problem: What's wrong with the countess's taste in weight or her taste in overspending.
       Solution: The formerly galmorous countess is now continually mocked in the tabloids for her taste in clothing, he weight, and her overspending.

  - 9. The suspect's condition was upgraded from serious to fair after he fell from a third-story balcony while trying to evade arrest.
       Problem: Who knew that falling off a balcony could have health benefits.
       Solution: The suspect, who fell from a third-story balcony while trying to evade arrest, has had his condition upgraded from serious to fair.

### Squinting Modifiers

In some cases, the placement of a modifier is not so much wrong as ambiguous, in that it could apply to either
the element that precedes it or the one that follows. Such construction are called `squinting modifiers`
or `two-way modifiers` as they seems to be looking in both directions. For example:

- INCORRECT - The coach said on Thursday we'd have to start working harder.

Was this said on Thursday, or would the hard work begin on Thrusday?
This sentence should read as one of the following:

- CORRECT - On Thrusday, the coach said we'd have to start working harder.
- CORRECT - The coach said we'd have to start working harder on Thursday.

An squinting modifier cab be particularly difficult to notice, since if you read the sentence in a right way it doesn't appear
to contain a problem. It's a good example of why it is always advisable to have someone else look over your work: this is the
sort of error a fresh eye is liklier to spot.

- EXERCISE

  - 10. The gallery that was featured in the evening news recently had another major exhibit.
        Problem: The gallery was recently featured, or it recently had an exhibit?
        Solution: The gallery that was recently featured in the evening news had another major exhibit.
        Solution: The gallery that was feature in the evening news had another major exhibit recently.

  - 11. The tramp being asked to leave rudely replied that one could tell him what to do.
        Problem: Who was speaking rudely: the tramp or the person asking him to leave?
        Solution: Upon being rudely asked to leave, the tramp replied that no one could tell him what to do.
        Solution: The tramp being asked to leave replied rudely that no one would tell him what to do.

  - 12. Climbing stairs very rapidly gets you into good conditions.
        Problem: Does this mean that racing up the stairs will eventually get you into good condition - or that trudging up them at any pace is a quick way of getting into shape?
        Solution: Climbing stairs very rapidly is a way of getting into shape.
        Solution: Climbing stairs get you into good condition very rapidly.

## Tense and Mood

- A Tense is the form that a verb takes to indicate the time of its action.

- 1. Present, Past, Future
     - Each has following four varients - Simple, Progressive, Perfect, Perfect Progressive
     - A few other varients that have less broad application
       - PRESENT EMPHATIC, and PAST EMPHATIC
         - To accentuate(make more noticeable or prominent) statement in simple past, and simple present.
       - HABITUAL PAST
         - To describe something that used to occur on a regular basis.
       - FUTURE IN THE PAST
         - to express idea that at an earlier time point, there had been an expectation that something would later happen.

- 2. Every VERB can be formed in four ways
     - BASE Form - refular verb - first Form.
     - PAST Form - adding `ed`, `d`, `t` in the end of the base form.
     - PRESENT Participle - formed by adding `ing` to the base form.
     - PAST Participle - past form of regular verb

- 3. The nature of a verb restricts whice tenses it can take on. One of the ways in which verbs can be categorized is

  - DYNAMIC Verbs
    - Also called NORMAL, involve actions or processes. for example, jump, write, whisper, cough, melt, memorize
    - These actions or processes do not have to be observable,
      but they all involve something happening or being done, with a START and a FINISH
  - STATIC Verbs
    - Also called NON-CONTINUOUS, involve perceptions, emotions, or that relationship between things
      for example, want, like, believe, need, prefer, contain, resemble
  - Few Verbs can be used as DYNAMIC as well as STATIC

- 4. In addition to the main verb, almost all tenses inclide auxiliary verbs
     - Common auxiliary verbs are `have`, `be`, `will`, `can`, and `would`

- 5. Verb usage in Active and Passive voice
- 6. The mood of a verb deals with the concept of whether a statement is
     - expressing a fact (indicative mood)
     - a possibility or liklihood (condition mood)
     - a command or instruction (imperative mood)
