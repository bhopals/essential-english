# Grammatically Correct (Anne Stilman)

## Positioning of Modifiers

- A Modifier is an element of a sentence that describes or qualifies some other element.
- Adjectives, and adverbs are the most common modifiers, but a phrase or dependent clause can act as one too.
- All elements in a sentence must be positioned so that any modifier is acting upon what it is supposed to.
  Failure to do so may lead to some disconcerning results. There are THREE types of problems to look out for:

  - DANGLING MODIFIERS
  - MISPLACED MODIFIERS
  - SQUINTING MODIFIERS

### Dangling Modifiers

If a sentence is carelessly constructed so that entity to be modified is implied rather than explicitly stated, the modifier
is left `dangling` - left at loose ends as it were - and in the absense of the intended `modify-ee`, ends up latching onto
whatever happens to come next, resulting in a nonsense sentence, For example:

- INCORRECT - `Just two years after finishing graduate school, Adelaide career took off.`

Presumably, it was Adelaide who finished grad school, but she makes no direct appearance in the sentence; ONLY HER CAREER DOES.
Gramattically, what is being said here is that Aldelaide's career finished grad school and then took off :D
The above Problem can be REMEDIED by rewording either the PHRASE or the CLAUSE.

- CORRECT - `Just two years after Aldelaide finished graduate school, her career took off.`
- CORRECT - `Just two years after finishing graduate school, Aldelaide saw her career took off.`

The absurdities that result from dangling modifiers can range from the obvious to the subtle.
Fortunately, even when syntax is garbled, readers are usually able to process a sentence in the way the writers intended it.

### Misplaced Modifiers

Like a Dangling modifier , a misplaced modifier acts on something other than what the writer intended.
In this case, the problem is not that the `intended subject` isn't clearly identified in the sentence but
that the modifier is in the wrong position relative to what it should be affecting.
(Whenver possible, the two elements should lie right next to each other) For example:

- INCORRECT - `We put out an appeal for more volunteers to help with the fall program at last week's meeting.`

Presumbly, what happended at last week's meeting was an appeal for help with the fall program, but the positioning of
the modifier makes it sound as if the fall program itself was held at last week's meeting. The Problem can be remedied
by moving the modifying phrase.

- CORRECT - `At last week's meeting, we put out an appeal for more volunteers to help with the fall program.`
