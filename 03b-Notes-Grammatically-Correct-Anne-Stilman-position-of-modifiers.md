# Grammatically Correct (Anne Stilman)

## Positioning of Modifiers

- A Modifier is an element of a sentence that describes or qualifies some other element.
- Adjectives, and adverbs are the most common modifiers, but a phrase or dependent clause can act as one too.
- All elements in a sentence must be positioned so that any modifier is acting upon what it is supposed to.
  Failure to do so may lead to some disconcerning results. There are THREE types of problems to look out for:

  - DANGLING MODIFIERS
  - MISPLACED MODIFIERS
  - SQUINTING MODIFIERS

### Dangling Modifiers

If a sentence is carelessly constructed so that entity to be modified is implied rather than explicitly stated, the modifier
is left `dangling` - left at loose ends as it were - and in the absense of the intended `modify-ee`, ends up latching onto
whatever happens to come next, resulting in a nonsense sentence, For example:

- INCORRECT - Just two years after finishing graduate school, Adelaide career took off.

Presumably, it was Adelaide who finished grad school, but she makes no direct appearance in the sentence; ONLY HER CAREER DOES.
Gramattically, what is being said here is that Aldelaide's career finished grad school and then took off :D
The above Problem can be REMEDIED by rewording either the PHRASE or the CLAUSE.

- CORRECT - Just two years after Aldelaide finished graduate school, her career took off.
- CORRECT - Just two years after finishing graduate school, Aldelaide saw her career took off.

The absurdities that result from dangling modifiers can range from the obvious to the subtle.
Fortunately, even when syntax is garbled, readers are usually able to process a sentence in the way the writers intended it.
