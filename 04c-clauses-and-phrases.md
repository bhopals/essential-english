## Clauses

- Units of sentence that contain at least one predicate (verb) and a subject.
- A clause, therefore, contains a single verb group
  - Words and phrases are parts of language that make up clauses
- A simple sentence contains only one clause.
- Examples
  - Doug `played`
  - Sunny `cooked` dinner
  - A man in Miami `swam` in the river.
  - Jennifer `has been dreaming` during class
- A verb group can consist of a single word (such as `played`, `cooked`, `swam`)
  or combine multiple words (`has been dreaming`)

- Difference between a `Phrase` and a `Clause`
  - A clause is different than Phrase. A clause is a group of words with a verb and a subject.
  - A phrase does not have a verb and subject.

### Types of Clauses

- Two main types

  - Independent (Main Clauses)
  - Dependent (Subordinate Clauses)

- Independent Clauses

  - A complete sentence
    - It contains a subject and verb and expresses a complete thought in both context and meaning.
  - Examples
    - The door opened.
  - Independent clauses can be joined by a COORDINATION CONJUNCTIONS to form complex or compound sentences.
  - Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS)
    - `for`, `and`, `nor`, `but`, `or`, `yet`, `so`
  - Example
    - Take two independent clauses and join them together with the conjunction `and`
      - The door opened.
      - The man walked in.
      - The door opened `and` the man walked in.

- Dependent Clauses

  - A clause that cannot be a sentence by itself.
    - A part of a sentence: It contains a Subject and verb, but does not express a complete thought.
  - They can make sense on their own but they are dependent on the rest of the sentence for context and meaning.
  - Dependent clauses can be `NOMINAL`, `ADVERBIAL` or `ADJECTIVIAL`
  - They are usually joined to be an independent clauses to form a complex sentence.
  - Dependent clauses often begin with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun
    that makes the clause unable to stand alone
  - Subordinating Conjunctions
    - List
      - `after`, `although`, `as`, `becuase`, `before`, `even if`, `even though`, `if`, `in order that`, `once`
      - `provided that`, `rather than`, `since`, `so that`, `than`, `that`, `though`, `unless`, `until`
      - `when`, `whenever`, `where`, `whereas`, `wherever`, `whether`, `while`, `why`
    - An independent clause: `She is older than her brother`
      - Though it could be its own sentence, it can be turned into a dependent or subordinate clause
        when the same group of words begings with a dependent word (or a subordination conjunction in this case)
        - `Because she is older than her brother, she tells him what to do`
  - Relative Pronouns

    - List
      - `that`, `which`, `whichever`, `who`, `whoever`, `whom`, `whose`, `whosever`, `whomever`
    - Examples
      - `Whichever` book you choose, you won't be disappointed.

  - Clauses are also classified as `restrictive` and `nonrestrictive` clauses.
    - The words essential and nonessential are sometimes used to mean the same thing as
      restrictive and nonrestrictive, respectively.
    - A nonrestrictive clause is not essential to the meaning of the sentence; it can be removed
      from the sentence without changing its basic meaning.
    - Nonrestrictive clauses are often set apart from the rest of the sentence by a comma or
      a pair of commas (if it is in the middle of a sentence)
    - Examples
      - Professor Villa, who used to be a secretary for the President, can type 132 words in a minute.

- Nominal Clause

  - A clause that functions like a noun or noun phrase
  - A group of words containing a subject and a finitie verb of its own and contains
    one of the following
    - `that`, `if`, `whether`
  - Examples
    - I wondered `whether` the assignment was necessary.
  - Nominal Clauses answer questions like `who`, `whom` or `what`

- Adverbial Clause

  - A clause that is a word or expression in the sentence that functions as an adverb, i.e.
    - It tells you something about `how the action in the verb was done`.
  - An Adverbial clause is separated from other clauses by any of the following subordinating conjunctions.

    - `after`, `although`, `as`, `because`, `before`, `if`, `since`, `that`, `though`
    - `till`, `unless`, `until`, `when`, `where`, `while`

  - Example
    - They will visit you `before` they go to the airport.
  - Adverbial clause can also be placed before the main clause without changing the meaning
  - Example
    - Before they go to he airport, they will visit you.
  - Adverb clauses answer questions like `when`, `where`, `why`
  - When an adverb clause introduces the sentence (as this one does), it is set off with a comma

  - Adjectival Clause
    - A clause that does the work of an adjective and describes a noun.
    - It is usually introduced by a relative pronoun (who, whom, whose, that, which)
    - Example
      - I went to the show that was very popular
    - This kind of clause is used to provide extra information about the noun it follows.
    - This can be used to define something (a defining clause), or provide unnecessary, but interesting
      added information (a non-defining clause)

- An Example of Defining Relative Clause

  - The car that is parked in front of the gates that will be towed away.
    - Information contained in defining the relative clause is absolutely essential in order for us
      to be able to identify the car in the question.

- An Example of Non-defining Relative Clause

  - My dog, who is grey and white, chased a postman.
    - A non-defining relative clause is separated from the rest of the sentence by commas.
    - If you take away the non-defining clause the basic meaning of the sentence remains intact.
      - Examples
        - My Dog chased the postman
  - Adjective clauses answer question like `which` or `what kind of`

- Dependent Clause summary
  - An ADJECTIVE clause functions as an adjective (modifies a noun or pronoun)
  - An ADVERB clause functions as an adverb (describes a verb, adjective or that adverb)
  - A NOMINAL clause is used as a noun (subject of a verb, direct object, indirect object,
    predicate nominative or object of the preposition)
