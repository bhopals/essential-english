### Moods (Conditional)

- `Indicative`, `imperative`, `subjunctive` and `infinitive` are the four moods of English verbs.
  All manners and moods are expressed through these four verbs.

- 1. Infinitive Mood

  - Verbs in the infinitive mood are used as parts of speech more than verbs. It expresses being or action.
  - Examples
    - I may go `to the beach` later.
    - They came `to speak` to me.
    - It's important `to eat` well.

- 2. Indicative Mood

  - We use the indicative mood to express `assertion`, `denial`, and `question`
  - Examples
    - Heathrow is the world's busiest airport.(Assertion)
    - Oliver cannot speak English. (Denial)
    - Do you work in the city? (Question)

- 3. Imperative Mood

  - We use the imperative mood to express `requests`, `commands` and `advice`/`instructions`
  - The subject of the sentence always understood to be `YOU`
  - It always uses the base form of the verb
  - Examples
    - Please don't talk in lesson. (Request)
    - Look out! (Advice)
    - Shut that door. (Command)

- 4. Subjunctive/Conditional Mood

  - We use the subjunctive mood to express `unreal situations`, `possibility` and `wish`.
  - Examples
    - If I were rich, I would buy a sports car.(Unreal)
    - We might find her ring if we were to look hard enough.(Possibility)
    - I wish it would stop raining.(Wish)
