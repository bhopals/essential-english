## Structure and Syntax

### Agreement Between Subject and Verb

- When a NOUN or PRONOUN is singular, the VERB that applies to it takes a singular form
- When a NOUN or PRONOUN is plural, the VERB that applies to it takes a plural form.
- This is known as AGREEMENT BETWEEN SUBJECT and VERB.

- 1. Compound Subject linked by `and`

  - A sentence may contain a `compound subject`: two or more nouns, pronouns, gerunds, or infinitives that
    share the same verb and are linked by the conjunction `and`. With a Few EXCEPTIONS, the verb for compound subject is plural. This applies whether each part of the compound is itself SINGULAR OR PLURAL.
  - EXAMPLES
    - Your enthusiasm and participation `are` much appreciated.
    - Her understanding and attention span `have` improved.
    - Whether a relationship between these events actually exists and if so whether it is casual `remain` to be shown.
  - EXCEPTIONS

    - if two elements make up a single entity, they take a singular verb.
    - Examples
      - Gin and tonis `was` his preferred drink.
      - Drinking and driving `is` a crime.
      - Plucking and cleaning a chicked `was` an unpleasant task.
      - Calculating and plotting the points on the graph `is` the most time-consuming part of the exercise.
      - The invoice and purchase order `have` to be approved.

  - If a subject is Preceded by `each` and `every`, the verb associated with the subject is alwys singular, even
    if the subject would otherwise be treated as a plural.

    - EXAMPLES

      - `Each` invoice and purchase order `has` to be prepared.
      - `Every` invoice and purchase order `has` to be prepared.
      - `Each` of the invoice and purchase order `has` to be prepared.
      - `Every` one of the invoice and purchase order `has` to be prepared.
      - `Each` and `Every` invoice and purchase order `has` to be prepared.

      - If `Each` comes after a compound subject rather than before it, the verb is plural.
        - The invoices and purchase orders each `have` to be approved.

- 2. Compound Subject linked by `or`

  - When two subjects that share a verb are linkecd by the conjunction or, nor, or but, the verb agrees with whichever
    part is closest to it.
    - EXAMPLES
      - Either the bookcases or the filling cabinets `need` to go somewhere else.
      - Either the bookcase or the filling cabinet `needs` to go somewhere else.
      - Either the bookcase or the filling cabinets `need` to go somewhere else.
      - Either the bookcases or the filling cabinet `needs` to go somewhere else.
      - One or the other of you `has` to compromise.
      - Not only the students but also the teacher `has` signed the petition.
      - Whether the workers or the supervisor `was` responsible was a matter of a debate.
      - Whether the tablecloth or the placemats `go` on the table is up to you.

- 3. Distracting parenthetical nouns

  - When a subject is followed by a mention of another entity, there is a risk of mistaking this other entity for the
    second part of a compound subject.

    - EXAMPLES

      - Both the principal and the vice principal `are` away at a conference. (Compound Subject)
      - The principal, as well as the vice principal, `is` away at a conference. (Subject + Parenthetical Element(, ,))
      - His chronic tardiness, as well as his negative attitude, `disrupts` the class.
      - The professor, accompained by some graduate students, `was` just entering the building.
      - Some professors, accompained by some graduate students, `were` just entering the building.
      - A parcel, along with a multitude of letters, `was` delivered the next day.
      - Anxiety about her health, in addition to her finanacial woes, `has` led her to seek conunseling.
      - His perseverance, no less than his pleasant manner, `makes` him a credibly candidate for the job.
      - The entire room, except for the two side doors, `is` to be painted.

    - Of course, if the subject is preceding the parenthetical phrase is plural, the verb will be PLURAL.
      - The guidance councelors, as well as secretaries, `are` away at a conference.
    - Note that the PARENTHETICAL elements in the above examples are enclosed in COMMAS. While technically
      these are required, they may sometimes be dropped for reasons of style. If you OMIT the commas, this
      does not effect the rule described above. You would still disregard the parenthetical
    - Examples
      - The library as well as the chapel `stands` on a rolling green hill.
      - The new workload on top of my other duties `is` unreasonable.

- 4. Distracting Modifying Nouns

  - When a subject is followed by an element that further defines it, there is a risk of mistaking the noun
    contained in this element for the subject itself.
  - EXAMPLES
    - This set `is` not complete.
    - These instructions `are` not complete.
    - This set of instructions `is` not complete.
    - The puppils in her class `are` extraordinary well behaved.
    - The inscriptions on the tombstone `were` almost worn away.
    - An extensive collection of medieval manuscripts `is` maintained in the library.
    - Engaging in contact sports `is` not for the faint of heart.
    - An assortment of ribbons and bows `was` lying in the drawer.
    - The inclusion of intervening words between subjects and verb often `causes` confusion.
    - The use of correction fluid or other methods that mask the original data `is` not permitted.
  - Errors attributable to this type of sentence structure seem limited to when the subject is singular and the phrase
    contains a plural noun.

- 4. Distracting Predicate Nouns

  - With the subject is the center of interest in a sentence, the predicate is what provides information about the subject,
    either describing it or identifying an action that it performs or that is performed upon it.
  - If the predicate happens to include a noun, there is a risk of mistaking this noun for the subject itself.
    This will cause errors in agreement if the subject is singular and the predicate noun is plural, or vice versa.
  - EXAMPLES

    - Her never-ending rants `are` the biggest irritant.
    - The biggest irritant `is` her never-ending rants.
    - The only deductible item on my tax return `is` my charitable expenses.
    - My charitable expenses `are` the only deductible item on my tax return.
    - Her best feature `is` her eyes.
    - Her eyes `are` her best feature.
    - The ongoing crises and tantrumsin the office `were` a nightmare.
    - The main thing needed `is` cooler heads.
    - The most annoying problem with the house `was` its creaky floors.

  - The error of focusing on the wrong noun is liklier to happen if other words intervene between the subject and the verb.
  - Remember, it is not proximity to the verb that determines which word acts as the subject.

- 5. Inverted Subject-Verb Order

  - In English, the subject usually precedes the verb: `Seth has a good memory`; `his idea was full-proof`.
  - However, this order is reversed in sentences that are constructed as questions, or that open with phrasing such as
    `there were` or `it is`, or that say `what` was done before saying `who` did it.
  - In these situations, writers are more apt to make errors in agreement, either becuase they are focusing only on whatever
    immediately follows the verb and neglect to look further, or because they get distracted by a noun that precedes the verb.
    However, the same rules described above apply here as well.

    - EXAMPLES

      - Into each project `go` hours(Subject) of hard work.
      - Included in the total `are` the five spare componentes(Subject).
      - Among the guests coming tonight `is` my cousin's new fiance (Subject).

    - If you are ever uncertain about how to deal with an inverted sentence, try mentally turning it around
      or dropping any distracting elements.

      - the component `are` included.
      - my cousin's fiance `is` coming.

    - EXAMPLES (with Compound Subject - `and`)

      - `Have` the plates and glasses been put away.
      - `Do` your brother and his friend need a place to stay tonight.
      - Walking a purposefully up to the house `were` the trainer and his assistants.
      - There `are` only five textbooks and one computer available for the entire class.

    - EXAMPLES (with Compound Subject - `or`)
      - There `is` no paper or pencil to be found anywhere.
      - There `is` neither prestige nor profits to be gained.
      - There `are` no pencila or paper to be found anywhere.
      - `Are` neither my rights nor my reputation to be considered?
      - What `are` the main issues at stake here?
      - Where `are` my shoes?
      - There `are` still tons of debris to be cleared.

- 6. Collective Nouns

  - Collective noun refers to an entity made up of more than one thing or person: `crowd`, `government`, `flock`.
    Whether such a word functions as a singular or a plural depends on a several factors.

  - RULES

    - SOME ARE ALWAYS SINGULAR OR ALWAYS PLURAL
      - EXAMPLES
        - The mob `was` turning ugly.
        - Where `are` the binoculares
      - Items that are made up of two connected parts often take a plural construction.
        - `scissors`, `glasses`, `pliers`, `tweezers`. (PLURAL)
      - They are only properly treated as singular if preceded by the phrase `a pair of`
        - `a pair of scissors`, `a pair of glasses`, `a pair of pliers`, `a pair of tweezers`. (SINGULAR)
    - SOME ARE SINGULAR WHEN USED IN ONE SENSE, AND PLURAL IN ANOTHER
      - The new headquarters `are` in Paris.
      - Headquarters `is` waiting for an answer.
      - Statistics `is` the most difficult course in the program.
      - The statistics `show` that highway accidents are decreasing.
    - SOME CAN GO EITHER WAY
      - Some collective nouns may be treated as either plurals or singulars depending on whether the focus is on the
        unit or on the members it comprises.
      - EXAMPLES (Both versions are CORRECT)
        - The staff `seems` very competent / The staff `seem` very competent
        - The couple `has` two young daughters / The couple `have` two young daughter.
        - His family constantly `interfers` in his life / His family constantly `intefere` in his life.
    - SOME ARE DETERMINED BY CONTEXT
      - For those collective nouns that can normally go either way, the context sometimes dictates whether
        one form of the other is appropriate.
      - EXAMPLES
        - The staff `have` many specialized skills. [reference is to the individual staff member; verb is plural]
        - The couple `get` along very well together. [reference is to the two individual who make up the couple; verb is plural]
        - His family `is` very close-knit. [reference is to the unit; verb is singular]
    - BE CONSISTENT WITH COLLECTIVE NOUNS

      - With a collective noun that can go either way, be careful that you do not start referring to it as singular and then
        switch to plural, or vice versa.
      - INCORRECT USAGE
        - The couple `lives` in New York but `go` to Florida for the winter.
        - The committee `is` adamant that `their` recommendations be adopted.
        - My company `has` an Employment policy that `they have` adhered to for years.
        - After `their` big win, the team `feels` more relaxed.
        - The group of ticketholders `was` furiously demanding refunds of `their` money.
      - CORRECT USAGE (It can be fixed Either way. Just make sure its consistent - PLURAL==PLURAL / SINGULAR==SINGULAR)
        - The couple `lives` in New York but `goes` to Florida for the winter.
        - The committee `is` adamant that `its` recommendations be adopted.
        - My company `has` an Employment policy it `has` adhered to for years.
        - After `their` big win, the team `feel` more relaxed.
        - The group of ticketholders `was` furiously demanding refunds of `its` money.

    - TERMS OF QUANTITY

      - Although most popular plural subjects take plural verbs, plural nouns that refer to
        measurements of money, time, or distance are treated as singulars. That is, the sum is VIEWED AS A UNIT (SINGULAR).
      - EXAMPLES
        - Two hours `is` plenty of time.
        - Twelve yards of material `seems` like more that enough for a doll's dress.
        - Lying there is pain view `was` the missing four hundred thousands dollars.
        - Eleven cents `is` hardly going to cover lunch.
      - Of Course, if the emphasis is intended to be on the individual items, use a plural.
        - EXAMPLES
          - The forty minutes of the class `were` dragging by with agonizing slowness.
          - The thirteen dollars `were` laid on the table one by one.
      - Other terms of quantity may sometimes be treated as SINGULAR as well.
        - `Is` three pinches of salt too much?
        - A generation ago, no one in the world of figure skating would have believed that four revolutions in the air `was` possible.

    - INDEFINITE PRONOUNS

      - Pronouns that refer to a specific person, place, or thing don't cause difficulty when it comes to agreeing with a verb (it is, they are)
      - Somewhat trickier are INDEFINITE PRONOUNS, which are not tied to something specific. The ones that tend to be misused are those that
        refer to multitudes but are singular in construction and those that go both ways.

      - PRONOUNS in the FIRST CATEGORY Include:
        - `each`, `every`, `either`, `neither`, `anyone`, `anybody`, `someone`, `somebody`, `nobody`, `everything`, `everyone`, and `everybody`.
        - They ALWAYS TAKE A SINGULAR VERB.
        - EXAMPLES
          - Either candidate `seems` credible
          - Eitehr of the candidates `seems` credible.
          - Neither of us `wants` to go.
          - Neither of the options `is` acceptable.
          - Everything in the boxes `goes` into the large filing cabinet.
          - Where `has` everybody gone?
        - They are EVEN Singular when used in COMBINATIONS
          - EXAMPLES
            - Anything and everythings `goes`.
            - Anybody and everybody `is` welcome.
            - Each and every dis `was` chipped.
        - As with nounds, DO NOT be distracted by parenthetical or modifying phrases intervening between subject and verb.
          - EXAMPLES
            - Everything about her presentation - the talk, the overheads, and the handouts - `was` rated highly.
      - PRONOUNS in the SECOND CATEGORY Include:

        - `all`, `more`, `most`, `some`, `any`, and `none`.
        - These pronouns take a plural verb when associated with a MULTITUDE (indicating how many), and a singular form
          when associated with a UNIT (indicating how much)
        - EXAMPLES

          - All the chores `have` been completed. [how many;verb is plural]
          - All the snow `was` melted. [how much;verb is singular]
          - `Is` there any pepper in that shaker. [how much;verb is singular]
          - `Are` there any questions? [how many;verb is plural]

        - The pronoun `none` is somewhat controversial. Some authorities insist it must always treated
          as a contraction for `not one`, which makes it singular. However, constructions such as `None of the residents is wealthy`
          OR `None of the customer seems satisfied` can sound a bit pendantic, and there are many literary precedents to support
          using this word to mean `not any` as well. The decision as to how to treat it depends partly n whether a singular or
          plural notion predominates, and partly on how to formal a tone you wish to achieve.
          - EXAMPLES
            - The candidates seem interchangeable; none `stands` out as the best. [not one; verb is singular]
            - None but the foolhardy `eat` at this place. [not any; verb is plural]
            - None of these options `is` satisfactory. [This is acceptable. This is more FORMAL - singular]
            - None of these options `are` satisfactory. [This is also acceptable. This is less FORMAL - plural]

    - One of those people who `are` late for everything.
