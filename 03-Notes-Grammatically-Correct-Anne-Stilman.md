### Agreement Between Subject and Verb

- When a NOUN or PRONOUN is singular, the VERB that applies to it takes a singular form
- When a NOUN or PRONOUN is plural, the VERB that applies to it takes a plural form.
- This is known as AGREEMENT BETWEEN SUBJECT and VERB.

- 1. Compound Subject linked by `and`

  - A sentence may contain a `compound subject`: two or more nouns, pronouns, gerunds, or infinitives that
    share the same verb and are linked by the conjunction `and`. With a Few EXCEPTIONS, the verb for compound subject is plural. This applies whether each part of the compound is itself SINGULAR OR PLURAL.
  - EXAMPLES
    - Your enthusiasm and participation `are` much appreciated.
    - Her understanding and attention span `have` improved.
    - Whether a relationship between these events actually exists and if so whether it is casual `remain` to be shown.
  - EXCEPTIONS

    - if two elements make up a single entity, they take a singular verb.
    - Examples
      - Gin and tonis `was` his preferred drink.
      - Drinking and driving `is` a crime.
      - Plucking and cleaning a chicked `was` an unpleasant task.
      - Calculating and plotting the points on the graph `is` the most time-consuming part of the exercise.
      - The invoice and purchase order `have` to be approved.

    if the subject would otherwise be treated as a plural.

    - EXAMPLES
