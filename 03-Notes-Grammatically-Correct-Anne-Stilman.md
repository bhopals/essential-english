## Structure and Syntax

### Agreement Between Subject and Verb

- When a NOUN or PRONOUN is singular, the VERB that applies to it takes a singular form
- When a NOUN or PRONOUN is plural, the VERB that applies to it takes a plural form.
- This is known as AGREEMENT BETWEEN SUBJECT and VERB.

- 1. Compound Subject linked by `and`

  - A sentence may contain a `compound subject`: two or more nouns, pronouns, gerunds, or infinitives that
    share the same verb and are linked by the conjunction `and`. With a Few EXCEPTIONS, the verb for compound subject is plural. This applies whether each part of the compound is itself SINGULAR OR PLURAL.
  - EXAMPLES
    - Your enthusiasm and participation `are` much appreciated.
    - Her understanding and attention span `have` improved.
    - Whether a relationship between these events actually exists and if so whether it is casual `remain` to be shown.
  - EXCEPTIONS

    - if two elements make up a single entity, they take a singular verb.
    - Examples
      - Gin and tonis `was` his preferred drink.
      - Drinking and driving `is` a crime.
      - Plucking and cleaning a chicked `was` an unpleasant task.
      - Calculating and plotting the points on the graph `is` the most time-consuming part of the exercise.
      - The invoice and purchase order `have` to be approved.

  - If a subject is Preceded by `each` and `every`, the verb associated with the subject is alwys singular, even
    if the subject would otherwise be treated as a plural.

    - EXAMPLES

      - `Each` invoice and purchase order `has` to be prepared.
      - `Every` invoice and purchase order `has` to be prepared.
      - `Each` of the invoice and purchase order `has` to be prepared.
      - `Every` one of the invoice and purchase order `has` to be prepared.
      - `Each` and `Every` invoice and purchase order `has` to be prepared.

      - If `Each` comes after a compound subject rather than before it, the verb is plural.
        - The invoices and purchase orders each `have` to be approved.

- 2. Compound Subject linked by `or`

  - When two subjects that share a verb are linkecd by the conjunction or, nor, or but, the verb agrees with whichever
    part is closest to it.
    - EXAMPLES
      - Either the bookcases or the filling cabinets `need` to go somewhere else.
      - Either the bookcase or the filling cabinet `needs` to go somewhere else.
      - Either the bookcase or the filling cabinets `need` to go somewhere else.
      - Either the bookcases or the filling cabinet `needs` to go somewhere else.
      - One or the other of you `has` to compromise.
      - Not only the students but also the teacher `has` signed the petition.
      - Whether the workers or the supervisor `was` responsible was a matter of a debate.
      - Whether the tablecloth or the placemats `go` on the table is up to you.

- 3. Distracting parenthetical nouns

  - When a subject is followed by a mention of another entity, there is a risk of mistaking this other entity for the
    second part of a compound subject.

    - EXAMPLES

      - Both the principal and the vice principal `are` away at a conference. (Compound Subject)
      - The principal, as well as the vice principal, `is` away at a conference. (Subject + Parenthetical Element(, ,))
      - His chronic tardiness, as well as his negative attitude, `disrupts` the class.
      - The professor, accompained by some graduate students, `was` just entering the building.
      - Some professors, accompained by some graduate students, `were` just entering the building.
      - A parcel, along with a multitude of letters, `was` delivered the next day.
      - Anxiety about her health, in addition to her finanacial woes, `has` led her to seek conunseling.
      - His perseverance, no less than his pleasant manner, `makes` him a credibly candidate for the job.
      - The entire room, except for the two side doors, `is` to be painted.

    - Of course, if the subject is preceding the parenthetical phrase is plural, the verb will be PLURAL.
      - The guidance councelors, as well as secretaries, `are` away at a conference.
    - Note that the PARENTHETICAL elements in the above examples are enclosed in COMMAS. While technically
      these are required, they may sometimes be dropped for reasons of style. If you OMIT the commas, this
      does not effect the rule described above. You would still disregard the parenthetical
    - Examples
      - The library as well as the chapel `stands` on a rolling green hill.
      - The new workload on top of my other duties `is` unreasonable.

- 4. Distracting Modifying Nouns

  - When a subject is followed by an element that further defines it, there is a risk of mistaking the noun
    contained in this element for the subject itself.
  - EXAMPLES
    - This set `is` not complete.
    - These instructions `are` not complete.
    - This set of instructions `is` not complete.
    - The puppils in her class `are` extraordinary well behaved.
    - The inscriptions on the tombstone `were` almost worn away.
    - An extensive collection of medieval manuscripts `is` maintained in the library.
    - Engaging in contact sports `is` not for the faint of heart.
    - An assortment of ribbons and bows `was` lying in the drawer.
    - The inclusion of intervening words between subjects and verb often `causes` confusion.
    - The use of correction fluid or other methods that mask the original data `is` not permitted.
  - Errors attributable to this type of sentence structure seem limited to when the subject is singular and the phrase
    contains a plural noun.

- 4. Distracting Predicate Nouns

  - With the subject is the center of interest in a sentence, the predicate is what provides information about the subject,
    either describing it or identifying an action that it performs or that is performed upon it.
  - If the predicate happens to include a noun, there is a risk of mistaking this noun for the subject itself.
    This will cause errors in agreement if the subject is singular and the predicate noun is plural, or vice versa.
  - EXAMPLES

    - Her never-ending rants `are` the biggest irritant.
    - The biggest irritant `is` her never-ending rants.
    - The only deductible item on my tax return `is` my charitable expenses.
    - My charitable expenses `are` the only deductible item on my tax return.
    - Her best feature `is` her eyes.
    - Her eyes `are` her best feature.
    - The ongoing crises and tantrumsin the office `were` a nightmare.
    - The main thing needed `is` cooler heads.
    - The most annoying problem with the house `was` its creaky floors.

  - The error of focusing on the wrong noun is liklier to happen if other words intervene between the subject and the verb.
  - Remember, it is not proximity to the verb that determines which word acts as the subject.
